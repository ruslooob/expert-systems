ripem is a program which perform privaci enhanc mail ( pem ) use the cryptograph techniqu of rsa and de . it allow your electron mail to have the properti of authent ( i.e . who sent it can be confirm ) and privaci ( i.e . nobodi can read it except the intend recipi . ) ripem wa written primarili by mark riordan < mrr @ scss3.cl.msu.edu > . most of the code is in the public domain , except for the rsa routin , which are a librari call rsaref licens from rsa data secur inc. 2 ) how can i get ripem ? ripem contain the librari of cryptograph routin rsaref , which is consid munit and thu is export-restrict from distribut to peopl who are not citizen or perman resid of the u.s. or canada . therefor , the follow request is quot from the readm file : # pleas do not export the cryptograph code in thi distribut # outsid of the usa or canada . thi is a person request from me , # the author of ripem , and a condit of your use of ripem . note that rsaref is not in the public domain , and a licens for it is includ with the distribut . you should read it befor use ripem . the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copi , sinc thi will reduc the load on those site that do carri it ( not to mention the human that run them . ) natur thi requir that you trust the friend . ripem is avail via anonym ftp to citizen and perman resid in the u.s. from rsa.com ; cd to rsaref/ and read the readm file for info . last i look , thi site contain onli the sourc tree , and doe not contain compil binari or the nice mac version . ripem , as well as some other crypt stuff , ha it `` home site '' on rpub.cl.msu.edu , which is open to non-anonym ftp for user in the u.s. and canada who are citizen or perman resid . to find out how to obtain access , ftp there , cd to pub/crypt/ , and read the file getting_access . for conveni , binari for mani architectur are avail here in addit to the full sourc tree . 3 ) will ripem run on my machin ? probabl . it ha alreadi been port to ms-do and most flavor of unix ( suno , next , linux , aix , ultrix , solari , etc . ) port to macintosh includ a standard unix-styl port and a rather nice mac-lik port written by raymond lau , author of stuffit . more port are expect , and help of user is invit . 4 ) will ripem work with my mailer ? probabl . how easi and clean the effect interfac is will depend on the sophist and modular of the mailer , though . the user guid , includ with the distribut , discuss way to use ripem with mani popular mailer , includ berkeley , mush , elm , and mh . code is also includ in elisp to allow easi use of ripem insid gnu emac . if you make a new interfac for ripem or creat an improv on one in the distribut which you believ is conveni to use , secur , and may be use to other , feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem . 5 ) what is rsa ? rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetr , or public-key . thi mean that there are two differ , relat key : one to encrypt and one to decrypt . becaus one can not ( reason ) be deriv from the other , you may publish your encrypt , or public key wide and keep your decrypt , or privat key to yourself . anyon can use your public key to encrypt a messag , but onli you hold the privat key need to decrypt it . ( note that the `` messag '' sent with rsa is normal just the de key to the real messag . ( see `` what is de ? '' ) note that the abov onli provid for privaci . for authent , the fingerprint of the messag ( see `` what is a fingerprint , like md5 ? '' ) is encrypt with the sender 's privat key . the recipi can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the messag must have come from the sender . rsa wa name for the three men ( rivest , shamir and adleman ) who invent it . to find out more about rsa , ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt . 6 ) what is de ? de is the data encrypt standard , a wide use symmetr , or secret-key , crypto system . unlik rsa , de use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messag . howev , de is much faster than rsa . ripem use both de and rsa ; it gener a random key and encrypt your mail with de use that key . it then encrypt that key with the recipi 's public rsa key and includ the result in the letter , allow the recipi to recov the de key . de is sometim consid weak becaus it is somewhat old and use a key length consid too short by modern standard . howev , it should be reason safe against an oppon smaller than a larg corpor or govern agenc . it is not unlik that futur ripem will strengthen the symmetr cipher , possibl by use multipl encrypt with de . 7 ) what is pem , and how doe ripem relat ? pem is privaci enhanc mail , a system for allow easi transfer of encrypt electron mail . it is describ in rfc 1421-1424 ; these document have been approv and obsolet the old rfc 1113-1115 . ripem is not realli a complet implement of pem , becaus pem specifi certif for authent key , which ripem doe not handl at thi time . their addit is plan . 8 ) what 's thi about distribut and authent key ? for a remot user to be abl to send secur mail to you , she must know your public key . for you to be abl to confirm that the messag receiv came from her , you must know her public key . it is import that thi inform be accur ; if a `` bad guy '' convinc her that hi key is in fact your , she will send messag which he can read . ripem allow for three method of key manag : a central server , the distribut finger server , and a flat file . all three are describ in the ripem user guid which is part of the distribut . none of them provid perfect secur . 9 ) whi do all ripem public key look veri similar ? ripem public key begin with a pkc identifi describ variou characterist about the key , so the first bunch of charact in your key may be the same as those of lot of other peopl 's key . thi doe not mean your key are similar , but onli that they are the same class of key , were gener with the same program , are of the same length , etc . 10 ) what is a fingerprint , like md5 ? md5 is a messag digest algorithm produc by rsa data secur inc . it provid a 128-bit fingerprint , or cryptograph secur hash , of the plaintext . it is cryptograph secur becaus it is not possibl ( in a reason amount of comput ) to produc a differ plaintext which produc the same fingerprint . thu , instead of sign the entir messag with the sender 's privat key , onli the md5 of the messag need to be sign for authent . md5 is sometim use for other purpos ; for exampl , it is often use to map an input of arbitrari length to 128 bit of data , as a passphras interpret or cooki gener . md5 is describ in it entireti ( includ an implement in c ) in rfc 1321 . 11 ) what is pgp ? pgp is anoth cryptograph mail program call pretti good privaci . pgp ha been around longer than ripem , and work somewhat differ . pgp is not compat with ripem in ani way , though pgp doe also use rsa . some major differ between pgp and ripem : - pgp ha more key manag featur , particularli for user without a direct network connect . - ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probabl of work with other pem softwar . pgp make no attempt to be compat with anyth other than pgp ( in fact , pgp 1.0 is not compat with pgp 2.0 . ) - ripem use rsaref , a librari of rsa routin from rsa data secur inc. rsaref come with a licens which allow noncommerci use . pgp use it own implement of rsa which is not licens ; thu , pkp , the firm hold the u.s. patent on the rsa algorithm , claim that it is a infring of that patent to make , use or sell pgp in the u.s. or canada . in acknowledg of thi , pgp 's origin author , phil zimmermann , say in the document : # in fact , if you live in the usa , and you are not a feder agenc , # you should n't actual run pgp on your comput , becaus public # key partner want to forbid you from run my softwar . pgp is # contraband . - both pgp and ripem are export-restrict , and can not be sent outsid the u.s. and canada . howev , pgp alreadi exist on mani ftp site in europ and other place . whether you use pgp or ripem or whatev , the document to pgp is recommend read to anyon interest in such issu . note that the abov fact , both regard patent and export restrict , are somewhat controversi ; mani peopl think it should n't be that way , and some peopl interpret variou document differ . unfortun , discuss of it on the net inevit seem to produc more heat than light , and probabl belong in misc.legal.comput . ( see : `` disclaim '' ) 12 ) what about rpem ? rpem stand for rabin privaci enhanc mail . it wa similar to ripem , but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin ( which is not rsa ) in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa . it wa written by mark riordan , the same author as ripem . it distribut wa halt when , contrari to the belief of mani ( includ rabin ) , public key partner ( pkp ) claim that their patent wa broad enough to cover ani public-key cipher whose strength rest in the difficulti of factor product of larg prime , not just rsa . thi claim is not univers accept by ani mean , but wa not challeng for pragmat reason . rpem is not realli use anymor . it is not compat with ripem or pgp . 13 ) what is mime ? mime stand for multipurpos internet mail extens , and is describ in rfc 1341 . you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mim . how pem should interact with mime is not yet entir clear ; some peopl use the stopgap solut of have a mime type application/x-ripem in order to send ripem messag as mime one . i hope some standard will emerg . draft internet document exist on the matter . 14 ) i have thi simpl way to defeat the secur of ripem ...\",\n ' can somebodi pleas help me with inform about an american magnet corpor magstrip card reader that i recent bought local from a surplu dealer . on the rear it ha the follow inform : american magnet corpor carson , ca , usa magstrip card reader model 41 , p/n 507500 - 2300112311 it is fit with a cabl with a rs232 cannon 25-pin connector on the end and ha a separ power connector like the onc use with wall charger . frode',\n \" each chip includ the follow compon : the skipjack encrypt algorithm f , an 80-bit famili key that is common to all chip n , a 30-bit serial number u , an 80-bit secret key that unlock all messag encrypt with the chip hmmm . a thirti bit serial number . and , we are told , the unit key u is deriv determinist from thi serial number . that mean that there are onli one billion possibl unit key . to gener the unit key for a serial number n , the 30-bit valu n is first pad with a fix 34-bit block to produc a 64-bit block n1 . s1 and s2 are then use as key to triple-encrypt n1 , produc a 64-bit block r1 : r1 = e [ d [ e [ n1 ; s1 ] ; s2 ] ; s1 ] . similarli , n is pad with two other 34-bit block to produc n2 and n3 , and two addit 64-bit block r2 and r3 are comput : r2 = e [ d [ e [ n2 ; s1 ] ; s2 ] ; s1 ] r3 = e [ d [ e [ n3 ; s1 ] ; s2 ] ; s1 ] . r1 , r2 , and r3 are then concaten togeth , give 192 bit . the first 80 bit are assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 . the rest are discard . the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2 . u1 and u2 are the key part that are separ escrow with the two escrow agenc . hmmm . we must assum that gener the unit key u from the serial number n rather than gener it from a randomli select u1 and u2 is an intent way of assur a `` fail safe '' for the govern -- u is completedli determin given s1 , s2 and n. if s1 and s2 do not chang they constitut effect `` master key '' ( along with f ) , the theft of which ( or the possess of which by variou author ) complet obviat the secur of the system . howev , more interestingli , we know , for a fact that if s1 and s2 are fix no matter what the keyspac for u is no more than 2^30 . whi not pick u1 and u2 at random ? whi thi interest restrict of they key space if it not to provid an addit back door ? i find it disturb that at the veri best my secur is depend on approxim 30 byte worth of inform that could be written on the back of a napkin . even if s1 and s2 chang period , the rational behind thi restrict in the size of the keyspac seem strang if one is assum that the goal is secur -- and make perfect sens if the goal is an illus of secur . if s1 and s2 do not chang , even if they remain secret i wonder if they can somehow be back-deriv given enough unit key/seri number pair . we are assur that thi can not happen -- but no one understand how skipjack work outsid of govern offici and , soon , foreign intellig servic that gain the inform via espionag . presum we will eventu have the inform as well -- revers engin get more and more advanc everi year -- but by the time we know it may be too late . as a sequenc of valu for u1 , u2 , and u are gener , they are written onto three separ floppi disk . the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond key part u1 . the second disk is similar but contain the u2 valu . the third disk contain the unit key u . agent 1 take the first disk and agent 2 take the second disk . the third disk is use to program the chip . after the chip are program , all inform is discard from the vault and the agent leav . the laptop may be destroy for addit assur that no inform is left behind . none of thi make me feel the least bit secur . the silli notion of '' destroy the laptop '' appear to be yet anoth bizarr distract . we all know that you ca n't read data from dram that ha been turn off for more than a few moment . on the other hand , what we do n't know is whi there is a need to gener the unit key from s1 and s2 in the first place other than to weaken the system . we do n't know if the agent in question would resist a million in cash a piec for their inform -- it probabl worth hundr of million , so you can make the bribe arbitrarili hard to resist . and to tell you the truth , do thi in a `` vault '' rather than in joe random tempest-shield room with a laptop comput seem like melodrama design to make high-school dropout from peoria impress -- but it doe veri littl for most of the rest of us . the protocol may be chang slightli so that four peopl are in the room instead of two . the first two would provid the seed s1 and s2 , and the second two ( the escrow agent ) would take the disk back to the escrow agenc . what would thi provid ?

'' in contrast , the purpos of mathemat cryptolog is to precis formul and , if possibl , prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong . we say , for exampl , that a cryptosystem is secur against all ( passiv ) attack if ani nontrivi attack against the system ( as defin abov ) is too slow to be practic . if we can prove thi statement then we have confid that our cryptosystem will resist ani ( passiv ) cryptanalyt techniqu . if we can reduc thi statement to some well-known unsolv problem then we still have confid that the cryptosystem is n't easi to break . other part of cryptolog are also amen to mathemat definit . again the point is to explicitli identifi what assumpt we 're make and prove that they produc the desir result . we can figur out what it mean for a particular cryptosystem to be use properli : it just mean that the assumpt are valid . the same methodolog is use for cryptanalysi too . the cryptanalyst can take advantag of incorrect assumpt . often he can tri to construct a proof of secur for a system , see where the proof fail , and use these failur as the start point for hi analysi . * whi is the one-tim pad secur ? by definit , the one-tim pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintext , ciphertext , and key are all string ( say byte string ) of some length m , and e_k ( p ) is just the sum ( let 's say the exclus or ) of k and p. it is easi to prove mathemat that there are _no_ nontrivi single-ciphertext attack on the one-tim pad , assum a uniform distribut of key . note that we do n't have to assum a uniform distribut of plaintext . ( here 's the proof : let a be an attack , i.e. , an algorithm take two input f , g and produc one output h , with some probabl p that h = h ( p ) whenev f = f ( p ) and g = g ( e_k ( p ) ) ( i.e. , g = g ( k + p ) ) . then , becaus the distribut of k is uniform and independ of p , the distribut of k + p must also be uniform and independ of p. but also the distribut of c is uniform and independ of p. henc there is probabl exactli p that h = h ( p ) whenev f = f ( p ) and g = g ( c ) , over all p and c. thu a fortiori a is trivial . ) on the other hand the one-tim pad is _not_ secur if a key k is use for more than one plaintext : i.e. , there are nontrivi multiple-ciphertext attack . so to be properli use a key k must be thrown away after one encrypt . the key is also call a `` pad '' ; thi explain the name `` one-tim pad . '' * what 's a ciphertext-onli attack ? in the notat abov , a ciphertext-onli attack is one where f is constant . given onli some inform g ( e_k ( p_1 ) , ... , e_k ( p_n ) ) about n ciphertext , the attack ha to have some chanc of produc some inform h ( p_1 , ... , p_n ) about the plaintext . the attack is trivial if it ha just as good a chanc of produc h ( p_1 , ... , p_n ) when given g ( c_1 , ... , c_n ) for random c_1 , ... , c_n . for exampl , say g ( c ) = c , and say h ( p ) is the first bit of p. we can easili write down an attack -- -the `` guess attack , '' which simpli guess that h ( p ) is 1 . thi attack is trivial becaus it doe n't use the ciphertext : it ha a fifty-fifti chanc of guess correctli no matter what . on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produc one bit of inform about p , with 100 % success , use c. if it is fed a random c then the success rate drop to 50 % . so thi is a nontrivi attack . * what 's a known-plaintext attack ? the classic known-plaintext attack ha f ( p_1 , p_2 ) = p_1 , g ( c_1 , c_2 ) = ( c_1 , c_2 ) , and h ( p_1 , p_2 ) depend onli on p_2 . in other word , given two ciphertext c_1 and c_2 and one decrypt p_1 , the known-plaintext attack should produc inform about the other decrypt p_2 . note that known-plaintext attack are often defin in the literatur as produc inform about the key , but thi is pointless : the cryptanalyst gener care about the key onli insofar as it let him decrypt further messag . * what 's a chosen-plaintext attack ? a chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingli impract seri of _active_ attack on a cryptosystem : attack where the cryptanalyst feed data to the encryptor . these attack do n't fit into our model of passiv attack explain abov . anyway , a chosen-plaintext attack let the cryptanalyst choos a plaintext and look at the correspond ciphertext , then repeat until he ha figur out how to decrypt ani messag . more absurd exampl of thi sort of attack are the `` chosen-key attack '' and `` chosen-system attack . '' a much more import form of activ attack is a messag corrupt attack , where the attack tri to chang the ciphertext in such a way as to make a use chang in the plaintext . there are mani easi way to throw kink into all of these attack : for instanc , automat encrypt ani plaintext p as t , e_k ( h ( t+r+p ) , r , p ) , where t is a time-key ( sequenc number ) chosen anew for each messag , r is a random number , and h is a one-way hash function . here comma mean concaten and plu mean exclusive-or . * in mathemat term , what can you say about brute-forc attack ? consid the follow known-plaintext attack . we are given some plaintext p_1 , ... , p_ { n-1 } and ciphertext c_1 , ... , c_ { n-1 } . we'r also given a ciphertext c_n . we run through everi key k. when we find k such that e_k ( p_i ) = c_i for everi i < n , we print d_k ( c_n ) . if n is big enough that onli one key work , thi attack will succeed on valid input all the time , while it will produc correct result onli onc in a blue moon for random input . thu thi is a nontrivi attack . it onli problem is that it is veri slow if there are mani possibl key . * what 's a key-guess attack ? what 's entropi ? say somebodi is use the one-tim pad -- -but is n't choos key randomli and uniformli from all m-bit messag , as he wa suppos to for our secur proof . in fact say he 's known to prefer key which are english word . then a cryptanalyst can run through all english word as possibl key . thi attack will often succeed , and it 's much faster than a brute-forc search of the entir keyspac .\",\n '',\n ' hello , i am look for commerci softwar packag for profession fashion design . ani recommend and pointer are greatli appreci . pleas e-mail me , if you may . thank a million . -- ge',\n \" you can includ postscript epsi file in xfig ( encapsul postscript info file ) . you ca n't actual edit the postscript file , but you 're abl to draw over the postscript file . there a ep to epsi convert : eps2epsi ( perl program ) , succ ,\",\n \" i 'd lay long odd that it wa the other way around . clinton didn't just pull thi plan out of ani bodili orific ; the nsa ha to have been work on it for year . while it 's possibl that den ( and other promin peopl ) just happen to start argu for such a system , it seem more like that there wa a suggest involv . if thi guess is wrong , i apolog .\",\n ' the newest jdr microdevic catalog ha at least one variant of the hc11 .',\n '',\n \" help ! ! i need code/package/whatev to take 3-d data and turn it into a wirefram surfac with hidden line remov . i 'm use a do machin , and the code can be in ansi c or c++ , ansi fortran or basic . the data i 'm use form a rectangular grid . pleas post your repli to the net so that other may benefit . imho , thi is a gener interest question . thank you ! ! ! ! ! !\",\n \" we have a sun cd-rom drive which i would like to play audio cd 's in . i have an old 10 watt amplifi which work fine when connect to a junk `` walkman '' style am/fm radio . thi amp tie the common path of the earphon connect to ground . howev , it doe n't work with my soni walkman cassett player , or the cd drive , it produc of loud low-frequ tone . obvious soni doe n't ground the earphon output common . doe anyon have spec on the cd drive 's output ?

[ 2 ] whi use jpeg ? there are two good reason : to make your imag file smaller , and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data . make imag file smaller is a big win for transmit file across network and for archiv librari of imag . be abl to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbyte or so make a big differ in disk space and transmiss time ! ( if you are compar gif and jpeg , the size ratio is more like four to one . more detail below . ) if your view softwar doe n't support jpeg directli , you 'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipul imag . even with a jpeg-cap viewer , it take longer to decod and view a jpeg imag than to view an imag of a simpler format ( gif , for instanc ) . thu , use jpeg is essenti a time/spac tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an imag more cheapli . it 's worth note that when network or phone transmiss is involv , the time save from transfer a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . i 'll let you do the arithmet yourself . the other reason whi jpeg will gradual replac gif as a standard usenet post format is that jpeg can store full color inform : 24 bits/pixel ( 16 million color ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer color ) . if you have onli 8-bit display hardwar then thi may not seem like much of an advantag to you . within a coupl of year , though , 8-bit gif will look as obsolet as black-and-whit macpaint format doe today . furthermor , for reason detail in section 7 , jpeg is far more use than gif for exchang imag among peopl with wide vari color display hardwar . henc jpeg is consider more appropri than gif for use as a usenet post standard . [ 3 ] when should i use jpeg , and when should i stick with gif ? jpeg is * not * go to displac gif entir ; for some type of imag , gif is superior in imag qualiti , file size , or both . one of the first thing to learn about jpeg is which kind of imag to appli it to . as a rule of thumb , jpeg is superior to gif for store full-color or gray-scal imag of `` realist '' scene ; that mean scan photograph and similar materi . jpeg is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardwar , and it is a lot superior if you do . ( see section 7 for detail . ) gif doe significantli better on imag with onli a few distinct color , such as cartoon and line draw . in particular , larg area of pixel that are all * exactli * the same color are compress veri effici inde by gif . jpeg ca n't squeez these file as much as gif doe without introduc visibl defect . thi sort of imag is best kept in gif form . ( in particular , single-color border are quit cheap in gif file , but they should be avoid in jpeg file . ) jpeg also ha a hard time with veri sharp edg : a row of pure-black pixel adjac to a row of pure-whit pixel , for exampl . sharp edg tend to come out blur unless you use a veri high qualiti set . again , thi sort of thing is not found in scan photograph , but it show up fairli often in gif file : border , overlaid text , etc . the blurri is particularli objection with text that 's onli a few pixel high . if you have a gif with a lot of small-siz overlaid text , do n't jpeg it . computer-drawn imag ( ray-trac scene , for instanc ) usual fall between scan imag and cartoon in term of complex . the more complex and subtli render the imag , the more like that jpeg will do well on it . the same goe for semi-realist artwork ( fantasi draw and such ) . plain black-and-whit ( two level ) imag should never be convert to jpeg . you need at least about 16 gray level befor jpeg is use for gray-scal imag . it should also be note that gif is lossless for gray-scal imag of up to 256 level , while jpeg is not . if you have an exist librari of gif imag , you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg . you will lose a littl imag qualiti if you do . ( section 7 , which argu that jpeg imag qualiti is superior to gif , onli appli if both format start from a full-color origin . if you start from a gif , you 've alreadi irretriev lost a great deal of inform ; jpeg can onli make thing wors . ) howev , the disk space save may justifi convert anyway . thi is a decis you 'll have to make for yourself . if you do convert a gif librari to jpeg , see section 14 for hint . be prepar to leav some imag in gif format , sinc some gif will not convert well . [ 4 ] how well doe jpeg compress imag ? pretti darn well . here are some sampl file size for an imag i have handi , a 727x525 full-color imag of a ship in a harbor . the first three file are for comparison purpos ; the rest were creat with the free jpeg softwar describ in section 6b . file size in byte comment ship.ppm 1145040 origin file in ppm format ( no compress ; 24 bit or 3 byte per pixel , plu a few byte overhead ) ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file pass through unix compress compress doe n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note . other text-ori compressor give similar result . ship.gif 240438 convert to gif with ppmquant -f 256 | ppmtogif most of the save is the result of lose color info : gif save 8 bits/pixel , not 24 . ( see sec . 7 . ) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -q 95 ( highest use qualiti set ) thi is indistinguish from the 24-bit origin , at least to my nonprofession eyebal . ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -q 75 ( default set ) you have to look mighti darn close to distinguish thi from the origin , even with both on-screen at onc . ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -q 50 thi ha slight defect ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it 's been jpege without see the origin . still as good imag qualiti as mani recent post in usenet pictur group . ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -q 25 jpeg 's characterist `` blocki '' becom appar at thi set ( djpeg -blocksmooth help some ) . still , i 've seen plenti of usenet post that were of poorer imag qualiti than thi . ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optim ( -optim cut tabl overhead ) blocki , but perfectli satisfactori for preview or index purpos . note that thi file is tini : the compress ratio from the origin is 173:1 ! in thi case jpeg can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of compar qualiti ( the -q 75 file is everi bit as good as the gif , better if you have a full-color display ) . thi seem to be a typic ratio for real-world scene . [ 5 ] what are good `` qualiti '' set for jpeg ? most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. imag qualiti tradeoff by select a qualiti set . there seem to be widespread confus about the mean of these set . `` qualiti 95 '' doe not mean `` keep 95 % of the inform '' , as some have claim . the qualiti scale is pure arbitrari ; it 's not a percentag of anyth . the name of the game in use jpeg is to pick the lowest qualiti set ( smallest file size ) that decompress into an imag indistinguish from the origin . thi set will vari from one imag to anoth and from one observ to anoth , but here are some rule of thumb . the default qualiti set ( -q 75 ) is veri often the best choic . thi set is about the lowest you can go without expect to see defect in a typic imag . tri -q 75 first ; if you see defect , then go up . except for experiment purpos , never go abov -q 95 ; say -q 100 will produc a file two or three time as larg as -q 95 , but of hardli ani better qualiti . if the imag wa less than perfect qualiti to begin with , you might be abl to go down to -q 50 without objection degrad . on the other hand , you might need to go to a higher qualiti set to avoid further degrad . the second case seem to appli much of the time when convert gif to jpeg . the default -q 75 is about right for compress 24-bit imag , but -q 85 to 95 is usual better for convert gif ( see section 14 for more info ) . if you want a veri small file ( say for preview or index purpos ) and are prepar to toler larg defect , a -q set in the rang of 5 to 10 is about right . -q 2 or so may be amus as `` op art '' . ( note : the qualiti set discuss in thi articl appli to the free jpeg softwar describ in section 6b , and to mani program base on it . other jpeg implement , such as imag alchemi , may use a complet differ qualiti scale . some program do n't even provid a numer scale , just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' -style choic . ) [ 6 ] where can i get jpeg softwar ? most of the program describ in thi section are avail by ftp . if you do n't know how to use ftp , see the faq articl `` how to find sourc '' .

( the current xli is inde faster and more robust than the current xloadimag , at least with respect to jpeg file , becaus it ha the ijg v4 decod while xloadimag 3.03 is use a hacked-ov v1 . the next xloadimag releas will fix thi . ) xli is also free and avail from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z . both program are said to do the right thing with 24-bit display . ms-do : thi cover plain do ; for window or os/2 program , see the next head . one good choic is eric praetzel 's free dvpeg , which view jpeg and gif file . the current version , 2.4a , is avail by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97.50.50 ) , file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip . thi is a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386/486 machin . the user interfac is not flashi , but it 's function . anoth freewar jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei 's hiview . the current version , 1.2 , is avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip . hiview requir a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compat memori manag ( qemm386 and 386max work ; window and os/2 do not ) . hiview is current the fastest viewer for imag that are no bigger than your screen . for larger imag , it scale the imag down to fit on the screen ( rather than use panning/scrol as most viewer do ) . you may or may not prefer thi approach , but there 's no deni that it slow down load of larg imag consider . note : instal is a bit tricki ; read the direct care ! a sharewar altern is colorview for do ( $ 30 ) . thi is easier to instal than either of the two freewar altern . it user interfac is also much spiffier-look , although person i find it harder to use -- - more keystrok , inconsist behavior . it is faster than dvpeg but a littl slower than hiview , at least on my hardwar . ( for imag larger than screen size , dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than hiview . ) the current version is 2.1 , avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip . requir a vesa graphic driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directori . ( mani recent pc have a built-in vesa driver , so do n't tri to load a vesa driver unless colorview complain that the driver is miss . ) a second sharewar altern is fullview , which ha been kick around the net for a while , but i do n't know ani stabl archiv locat for it . the current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the abov viewer anyway . the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortli and it will be submit to the simtel20 archiv at that time . the well-known gif viewer compushow ( cshow ) support jpeg in it latest revis , 8.60a . howev , cshow 's jpeg implement is n't veri good : it 's slow ( about half the speed of the abov viewer ) and imag qualiti is poor except on hi-color display . too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capabl in cshow . sharewar , $ 25 . avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip . due to the remark varieti of pc graphic hardwar , ani one of these viewer might not work on your particular machin . if you ca n't get * ani * of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the follow convers program to convert jpeg to gif , then view with your favorit gif viewer . ( if you have hi-color hardwar , do n't use gif as the intermedi format ; tri to find a targa-cap viewer instead . vpic5.0 is reput to do the right thing with hi-color display . ) the independ jpeg group 's free jpeg convert are ftpabl from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extend memori ) . these file are do compil of the free sourc code describ in section 6b ; they will convert jpeg to and from gif , targa , and ppm format . handmad softwar offer free jpeg < = > gif convers tool , gif2jpg/jpg2gif . these are slow and are limit to convers to and from gif format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg . the major advantag of these tool is that they will read and write hsi 's proprietari jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format . sinc hsi-format file are rather widespread on bbse , thi is a use capabl . version 2.0 of these tool is free ( prior version were sharewar ) . get it from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip . note : do not use hsi format for file to be post on internet , sinc it is not readabl on non-pc platform . handmad softwar also ha a sharewar imag convers and manipul packag , imag alchemi . thi will translat jpeg file ( both jfif and hsi format ) to and from mani other imag format . it can also display imag . a demo version of imag alchemi version 1.6.1 is avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip . note about simtel20 : the internet 's key archiv site for pc-relat program is simtel20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88.110.20 ) . simtel20 run a non-unix system with weird directori name ; where thi document refer to directori ( eg ) `` msdos/graph '' at simtel20 , that realli mean '' pd1 : < msdos.graph > '' . if you are not physic on milnet , you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rate from simtel20 . there are sever internet site that maintain copi ( mirror ) of the simtel20 archiv ; most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead . a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210.10.117 ) , which keep simtel20 file in ( eg ) `` /pub/msdos/graph '' . if you have no ftp capabl , you can retriev file from simtel20 by e-mail ; see inform post in comp.archives.msdos.announc to find out how . if you are outsid the usa , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is . microsoft window : there are sever window program capabl of display jpeg imag .

( as of 11/92 , thi file contain quicktim 1.5 , which is better than qt 1.0 in sever way . with respect to jpeg , it is margin faster and consider less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file . howev , some applic seem to have compat problem with qt 1.5 . ) mac user should keep in mind that quicktim 's jpeg format , pict/jpeg , is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format . ( see section 10 for detail . ) if you post imag on usenet , make sure they are in jfif format . most of the program mention below can gener either format . the first choic is probabl jpegview , a free program for view imag that are in jfif format , pict/jpeg format , or gif format . it also can convert between the two jpeg format . the current version , 2.0 , is a big improv over prior version . get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx . requir system 7 and quicktim . on 8-bit display , jpegview usual produc the best color imag qualiti of all the current avail mac jpeg viewer . jpegview can view larg imag in much less memori than other mac viewer ; in fact , it' the onli one that can deal with jpeg imag much over 640x480 pixel on a typic 4mb mac . given a larg imag , jpegview automat scale it down to fit on the screen , rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer . ( you can zoom in on ani desir portion , though . ) some peopl like thi behavior , some do n't . overal , jpegview 's user interfac is veri well thought out . gifconvert , a sharewar ( $ 40 ) imag viewer/convert , support jfif and pict/jpeg , as well as gif and sever other imag format . the latest version is 2.3.2 . get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx . requir system 6.0.5 or later . gifconvert is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer , but it ha much more extens imag manipul and format convers capabl , so you may find it worth it sharewar fee if you do a lot of play around with imag . also , the newest version of gifconvert can load and save jfif imag * without * quicktim , so it is your best bet if your machin is too old to run quicktim . ( but it 's faster with quicktim . ) note : if gifconvert run out of memori tri to load a larg jpeg , tri convert the file to gif with jpeg convert , then view the gif version . jpeg convert , a mac version of the free ijg jpeg convers util , is avail from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx . thi will run on ani mac , but it onli doe file convers , not view . you can use it in conjunct with ani gif viewer . previou version of thi faq recommend imageri jpeg v0.6 , a jpeg < = > gif convert base on an old version of the ijg code . if you are use thi program , you definit should replac it with jpeg convert . appl 's free program pictpixi can view imag in jfif , quicktim jpeg , and gif format , and can convert between these format . you can get pictpixi from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . requir quicktim . pictpixi wa intend as a develop 's tool , and it' realli not the best choic unless you like to fool around with quicktim . some of it drawback are that it requir lot of memori , it produc rel poor color imag qualiti on anyth less than a 24-bit display , and it ha a rel unfriendli user interfac . wors , pictpixi is an unsupport program , mean it ha some minor bug that appl doe not intend to fix . ( there is an old version of pictpixi , call pictcompressor , float around the net . if you have thi you should trash it , as it 's even buggier . also , the quicktim starter kit includ a much cleaned-up descend of pictpixi call pictur compressor . note that pictur compressor is not free and may not be distribut on the net . ) storm technolog 's pictur decompress is a free jpeg viewer/convert . thi rather old program is inferior to the abov program in mani way , but it will run without system 7 or quicktim , so you may be forc to use it on older system . ( it doe need 32-bit quickdraw , so realli old machin can't use it . ) you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx . you must set the file type of a download imag file to 'jpeg ' to allow pictur decompress to open it . if your machin is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw ( a mac plu for instanc ) , gifconvert is your onli choic for single-program jpeg view . if you do n't want to pay for gifconvert , use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer . more and more commerci mac applic are support jpeg , although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format . adob photoshop , version 2.0.1 or later , can read and write jfif-format jpeg file ( use the jpeg plug-in from the acquir menu ) . you must set the file type of a download jpeg file to 'jpeg ' to allow photoshop to recogn it . amiga : ( most program list in thi section are store in the aminet archiv at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60.80.80 ) . there are mani mirror site of thi archiv and you should tri to use the closest one . in the usa , a good choic is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) hamlab plu is an excel jpeg viewer/convert , as well as be a gener imag manipul tool . it 's cheap ( sharewar , $ 20 ) and can read sever format besid jpeg . the current version is 2.0.8 . a demo version is avail from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror site ) , file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha . the demo version will crop imag larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwis fulli function . rend24 ( sharewar , $ 30 ) is an imag render that can display jpeg , ilbm , and gif imag . the program can be use to creat anim , even captur frame on-the-fli from render packag like lightwav . the current version is 1.05 , avail from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror site ) , file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha .

[ 7 ] what 's all thi hoopla about color quantiz ? most peopl do n't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardwar . typic display hardwar store 8 or fewer bit per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct color at a time . to display a full-color imag , the comput must map the imag into an appropri set of repres color . thi process is call `` color quantiz '' . ( thi is someth of a misnom , `` color select '' would be a better term . we 're stuck with the standard usag though . ) clearli , color quantiz is a lossi process . it turn out that for most imag , the detail of the color quantiz algorithm have much more impact on the final imag qualiti than do ani error introduc by jpeg ( except at the veri lowest jpeg qualiti set ) . sinc jpeg is a full-color format , convert a color jpeg imag for display on 8-bit-or-less hardwar requir color quantiz . thi is true for * all * color jpeg : even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg , what come out of the decompressor is * not * 256 color , but thousand of color . thi happen becaus jpeg 's lossi affect each pixel a littl differ , so two pixel that start with ident color will probabl come out with slightli differ color . each origin color get `` smear '' into a group of nearbi color . therefor quantiz is alway requir to display a color jpeg on a colormap display , regardless of the imag sourc . the onli way to avoid quantiz is to ask for gray-scal output . ( incident , becaus of thi effect it 's nearli meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg imag . even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel valu , differ jpeg decod would give you differ result becaus of roundoff error differ . i occasion see post imag describ as `` 256-color jpeg '' . thi tell me that the poster ( a ) ha n't read thi faq and ( b ) probabl convert the jpeg from a gif . jpeg can be classifi as color or gray-scal ( just like photograph ) , but number of color just is n't a use concept for jpeg . ) on the other hand , a gif imag by definit ha alreadi been quantiz to 256 or fewer color . ( a gif * doe * have a definit number of color in it palett , and the format doe n't allow more than 256 palett entri . ) for purpos of usenet pictur distribut , gif ha the advantag that the sender precomput the color quantiz , so recipi do n't have to . thi is also the * disadvantag * of gif : you 're stuck with the sender' quantiz . if the sender quantiz to a differ number of color than what you can display , you have to re-quant , result in much poorer imag qualiti than if you had quantiz onc from a full-color imag . furthermor , if the sender did n't use a high-qual color quantiz algorithm , you 're out of luck . for thi reason , jpeg offer the promis of significantli better imag qualiti for all user whose machin do n't match the sender 's display hardwar . jpeg 's full color imag can be quantiz to precis match the user 's display hardwar . furthermor , you will be abl to take advantag of futur improv in quantiz algorithm ( there is a lot of activ research in thi area ) , or purchas better display hardwar , to get a better view of jpeg imag you alreadi have . with a gif , you 're stuck forevermor with what wa sent . it 's also worth mention that mani gif-view program includ rather shoddi quantiz routin . if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display , for exampl , you are probabl get a much wors imag than you need to . thi is partli an inevit consequ of do two color quantiz ( one to creat the gif , one to display it ) , but often it' also due to sloppi . jpeg convers program will be forc to use high qualiti quantiz in order to get accept result at all , and in normal use they will quantiz directli to the number of color to be display . thu , jpeg is like to provid better result than the averag gif program for low-color-resolut display as well as high-resolut one ! final , an ever-grow number of peopl have better-than-8-bit display hardwar alreadi : 15-bit `` hi-color '' pc display , true 24-bit display on workstat and macintosh , etc . for these peopl , gif is alreadi obsolet , as it can not repres an imag to the full capabl of their display . jpeg imag can drive these display much more effect . thu , jpeg is an all-around better choic than gif for repres imag in a machine-independ fashion . [ 8 ] how doe jpeg work ? the buzz-word to know are chromin subsampl , discret cosin transform , coeffici quantiz , and huffman or arithmet entropi code . thi articl 's long enough alreadi , so i 'm not go to say more than that here . for technic inform , see the comp.compress faq . thi is avail from the news.answ archiv at rtfm.mit.edu , in file /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . if you need help in use the news.answ archiv , see the top of thi articl . [ 9 ] what about lossless jpeg ? there 's a great deal of confus on thi subject . the jpeg committe did defin a truli lossless compress algorithm , i.e. , one that guarante the final output is bit-for-bit ident to the origin input . howev , thi lossless mode ha almost noth in common with the regular , lossi jpeg algorithm , and it offer much less compress . at present , veri few implement of lossless jpeg exist , and all of them are commerci . say `` -q 100 '' to the free jpeg softwar doe not get you a lossless imag . what it doe get rid of is deliber inform loss in the coeffici quantiz step . there is still a good deal of inform loss in the color subsampl step . ( with the v4 free jpeg code , you can also say '' -sampl 1x1 '' to turn off subsampl . keep in mind that mani commerci jpeg implement can not cope with the result file . ) even with both quantiz and subsampl turn off , the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless , becaus it is subject to roundoff error in variou calcul . the maximum error is a few count in ani one pixel valu ; it 's highli unlik that thi could be perceiv by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are do machin process of an imag . at thi minimum-loss set , regular jpeg produc file that are perhap half the size of an uncompress 24-bit-per-pixel imag . true lossless jpeg provid roughli the same amount of compress , but it guarante bit-for-bit accuraci . if you have an applic requir lossless storag of imag with less than 6 bit per pixel ( per color compon ) , you may want to look into the jbig bilevel imag compress standard . thi perform better than jpeg lossless on such imag . jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on imag with 6 or more bit per pixel ; furthermor , jpeg is public domain ( at least with a huffman back end ) , while the jbig techniqu are heavili cover by patent . [ 10 ] whi all the argument about file format ? strictli speak , jpeg refer onli to a famili of compress algorithm ; it doe * not * refer to a specif imag file format . the jpeg committe wa prevent from defin a file format by turf war within the intern standard organ . sinc we ca n't actual exchang imag with anyon els unless we agre on a common file format , thi leav us with a problem . in the absenc of offici standard , a number of jpeg program writer have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' , and as a result their program are n't compat with anybodi els 's . the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that 's been coordin by peopl at c-cube microsystem . they have defin two jpeg-bas file format : * jfif ( jpeg file interchang format ) , a `` low-end '' format that transport pixel and not much els . * tiff/jpeg , aka tiff 6.0 , an extens of the aldu tiff format . tiff is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everyth you ever want to know about an imag , and a lot more besid : - ) . tiff is a lot more complex than jfif , and may well prove less transport , becaus differ vendor have histor implement slightli differ and incompat subset of tiff . it 's not like that ad jpeg to the mix will do anyth to improv thi situat . both of these format were develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg-rel product ; it 's reason like that futur commerci product will adher to one or both standard . i believ that usenet should adopt jfif as the replac for gif in pictur post . jfif is simpler than tiff and is avail now ; the tiff 6.0 spec ha onli recent been offici adopt , and it is still unus vagu on some crucial detail . even when tiff/jpeg is well defin , the jfif format is like to be a wide support `` lowest common denomin '' ; tiff/jpeg file may never be as transport . a particular case that peopl may be interest in is appl 's quicktim softwar for the macintosh . quicktim use a jfif-compat format wrap insid the mac-specif pict structur . convers between jfif and quicktim jpeg is pretti straightforward , and sever mac program are avail to do it ( see mac portion of section 6a ) . if you have an editor that handl binari file , you can strip a quicktim jpeg pict down to jfif by hand ; see section 11 for detail . anoth particular case is handmad softwar 's program ( gif2jpg/jpg2gif and imag alchemi ) . these program are capabl of read and write jfif format . by default , though , they write a proprietari format develop by hsi . thi format is not readabl by ani non-hsi program and should not be use for usenet post . use the -j switch to get jfif output . ( thi appli to old version of these program ; the current releas emit jfif format by default . you still should be care not to post hsi-format file , unless you want to get flame by peopl on non-pc platform . ) [ 11 ] how do i recogn which file format i have , and what do i do about it ? if you have an alleg jpeg file that your softwar wo n't read , it 's like to be hsi format or some other proprietari jpeg-bas format . you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file : 1 . a jfif-standard file will start with the charact ( hex ) ff d8 ff e0 , follow by two variabl byte ( often hex 00 10 ) , follow by 'jfif ' . 2 . if you see ff d8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a `` raw jpeg '' file . thi is probabl decod as-i by jfif softwar -- - it 's worth a tri , anyway . 3 . hsi file start with 'hsi1 ' . you 're out of luck unless you have hsi softwar . portion of the file may look like plain jpeg data , but they wo n't decompress properli with non-hsi program . 4 . a macintosh pict file , if jpeg-compress , will have a coupl hundr byte of header follow by a jfif header ( scan for 'jfif ' ) . strip off everyth befor the ff d8 and you should be abl to read it . 5 . anyth els : it 's a proprietari format , or not jpeg at all . if you are lucki , the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream . if you can identifi the start of the jpeg data stream ( look for ff d8 ) , tri strip off everyth befor that . in uuencod usenet post , the characterist jfif pattern is '' begin '' line m_ ] c_x ... wherea uuencod hsi file will start with '' begin '' line m : '-i ... if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the troubl of download non-jfif file . [ 12 ] what about arithmet code ? the jpeg spec defin two differ `` back end '' modul for the final output of compress data : either huffman code or arithmet code is allow . the choic ha no impact on imag qualiti , but arithmet code usual produc a smaller compress file . on typic imag , arithmet code produc a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman code . ( all the file-s number previous cite are for huffman code . ) unfortun , the particular variant of arithmet code specifi by the jpeg standard is subject to patent own by ibm , at & t , and mitsubishi . thu * you can not legal use arithmet code * unless you obtain licens from these compani . ( the `` fair use '' doctrin allow peopl to implement and test the algorithm , but actual store ani imag with it is dubiou at best . ) at least in the short run , i recommend that peopl not worri about arithmet code ; the space save is n't great enough to justifi the potenti legal hassl . in particular , arithmet code * should not * be use for ani imag to be exchang on usenet . there is some small chanc that the legal situat may chang in the futur . stay tune for further detail . [ 13 ] doe loss accumul with repeat compression/decompress ? it would be nice if , have compress an imag with jpeg , you could decompress it , manipul it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without ani further imag degrad beyond what you lost initi . unfortun thi is not the case . in gener , recompress an alter imag lose more inform , though usual not as much as wa lost the first time around . the next best thing would be that if you decompress an imag and recompress it * without chang it * then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an ident jpeg file . even thi is not true ; at least , not with the current free jpeg softwar . it 's essenti a problem of accumul of roundoff error . if you repeatedli compress and decompress , the imag will eventu degrad to where you can see visibl chang from the first-gener output . ( it usual take mani such cycl to get visibl chang . ) one of the thing on our to-do list is to see if accumul of error can be avoid or limit , but i am not optimist about it . in ani case , the most that could possibl be guarante would be that compress the unmodifi full-color output of djpeg , at the origin qualiti set , would introduc no further loss . even such simpl chang as crop off a border could caus further roundoff-error degrad . ( if you 're wonder whi , it 's becaus the pixel-block boundari move . if you crop off onli multipl of 16 pixel , you might be safe , but that 's a mighti limit capabl ! ) the bottom line is that jpeg is a use format for archiv storag and transmiss of imag , but you do n't want to use it as an intermedi format for sequenc of imag manipul step . use a lossless format ( ppm , rle , tiff , etc ) while work on the imag , then jpeg it when you are readi to file it away . asid from avoid degrad , you will save a lot of compression/decompress time thi way : - ) . [ 14 ] what are some rule of thumb for convert gif imag to jpeg ? as state earlier , you * will * lose some amount of imag inform if you convert an exist gif imag to jpeg . if you can obtain the origin full-color data the gif wa made from , it 's far better to make a jpeg from that . but if you need to save space and have onli the gif to work from , here are some suggest for get maximum space save with minimum loss of qualiti . the first rule when convert a gif librari is to look at each jpeg , to make sure you are happi with it , befor throw away the correspond gif ; that will give you a chanc to re-do the convers with a higher qualiti set if necessari . some gif may be better left as gif , as explain in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-typ gif with sixteen or fewer color do n't convert well . you may find that a jpeg file of reason qualiti will be * larger * than the gif . ( so check the size too . ) experi to date suggest that larg , high-visual-qu gif are the best candid for convers to jpeg . they chew up the most storag so offer the most potenti save , and they convert to jpeg with least degrad . do n't wast your time convert ani gif much under 100 kbyte . also , don't expect jpeg file convert from gif to be as small as those creat directli from full-color origin . to maintain imag qualiti you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg file would be ( i.e. , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file , not 1/4th as suggest in earlier comparison ) . mani peopl have develop an odd habit of put a larg constant-color border around a gif imag . while useless , thi wa nearli free in term of storag cost in gif file . it is not free in jpeg file , and the sharp border boundari can creat visibl artifact ( `` ghost '' edg ) . do yourself a favor and crop off ani border befor jpege . ( if you are on an x window system , xv 's manual and automat crop function are a veri painless way to do thi . ) cjpeg 's default q set of 75 is appropri for full-color input , but for gif input , q set of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessari to avoid imag degrad . ( if you appli smooth as suggest below , the higher q set may not be necessari . ) color gif of photograph or complex artwork are usual `` dither '' to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that gif can actual store . if you enlarg the imag , you will see that adjac pixel are often of significantli differ color ; at normal size the eye averag these pixel togeth to produc the illus of an intermedi color valu . the troubl with dither is that , to jpeg , it look like high-spatial-frequ color nois ; and jpeg ca n't compress nois veri well . the result jpeg file is both larger and of lower imag qualiti than what you would have gotten from jpege the origin full color imag ( if you had it ) . to get around thi , you want to `` smooth '' the gif imag befor compress . smooth averag togeth nearbi pixel , thu approxim the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process get rid of the rapid color chang that give jpeg troubl . appropri use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor , thu further reduc the size of the compress file , while still obtain a better-look output imag than you 'd get without smooth . with the v4 free jpeg softwar ( or product base on it ) , a simpl smooth capabl is built in . tri `` -smooth 10 '' or so when convert gif . valu of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-qual gif . heavy-hand dither may requir larger smooth factor . ( if you can see regular fine-scal pattern on the gif imag even without enlarg , then strong smooth is definit call for . ) too larg a smooth factor will blur the output imag , which you do n't want . if you are an imag process wizard , you can also do smooth with a separ filter program , such as pnmconvol from the pbmplu packag . howev , cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol ... the upshot of all thi is that `` cjpeg -qualiti 85 -smooth 10 '' is probabl a good start point for convert gif . but if you realli care about the imag , you 'll want to check the result and mayb tri a few other set . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - for more inform about jpeg in gener or the free jpeg softwar in particular , contact the independ jpeg group at jpeg-info @ uunet.uu.net .\",\n ' well here in australia you dial 11544 to get the number read back to you if you live in the countri includ the area code of the nearest capit citi eg for wa 09 11544 your mark',\n \" thi is a veri curiou thing to say . stu-iii ( nsa-design secur telephon clear for classifi traffic ) are alreadi readili avail to law enforc agenc . word ha it they 're standard in everi fbi offic , for exampl . someth like sever hundr thousand of these phone exist in all . they are clearli the us govern standard . so whi doe the doj need to buy new phone that , unlik stu-iii , will not be certifi for classifi traffic , and in all likelihood will not be compat with exist stu-iii ?

( see `` what is de ? '' ) note that the abov onli provid for disclosur protect . for origin authent , messag integr , and non-repudi of origin servic to be implement , the fingerprint of the messag ( see `` what is a fingerprint , like md5 ? '' ) is encrypt with the sender 's privat key . the recipi , or a dispute-resolv author , can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the messag must have come from the sender and wa not alter . rsa wa name for the three men ( rivest , shamir and adleman ) who invent it . to find out lot more about rsa and modern cryptographi in gener , ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ . some inform also may be in sci.crypt . 6 ) what is de ? de is the data encrypt standard , a wide use symmetr , or secret-key , crypto system . unlik rsa , de use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messag . howev , de is much faster than rsa . ripem use both de and rsa ; it gener a random key and encrypt your mail with de use that key . it then encrypt that key with the recipi 's public rsa key and includ the result in the letter , allow the recipi to recov the de key . de is sometim consid weak becaus it is somewhat old and use a key length consid too short by modern standard . howev , it should be reason safe against an oppon smaller than a larg corpor or govern agenc . it is not like that the pem standard will incorpor support for other symmetr cipher in the near futur , becaus there is a strong feel that pem should be stabl so it can becom util wide without earli problem with interoper . 7 ) what is a fingerprint , like md5 ? md5 is a messag digest algorithm produc by rsa data secur inc . it provid a 128-bit fingerprint , or cryptograph secur hash , of the plaintext . it is cryptograph secur becaus it is not possibl ( in a reason amount of comput ) to produc a differ plaintext which produc the same fingerprint . thu , instead of sign the entir messag with the sender 's privat key , onli the md5 of the messag need to be sign for authent . md5 can also be exchang directli for authent ; for exampl , ripem public key includ an md5 of the public key in the file , so parti wish to confirm their key are authent via a separ channel mere need exchang md5 of key and verifi their accuraci . md5 is sometim use for other purpos ; for exampl , it is often use to map an input of arbitrari length to 128 bit of data , as a passphras interpret or cooki gener . md5 is describ in it entireti ( includ an implement in c ) in rfc 1321 . there have been some recent suggest that md5 may not be as strong a hash as wa origin believ ; presum some other hash function will be use if thi is accept as true . 8 ) what is pem ? pem is privaci enhanc mail , a standard for allow transfer of encrypt electron mail gener over a long period of time by a work group of expert . it is describ in rfc 1421-1424 ; these document have been approv and obsolet the old rfc 1113-1115 . ripem is not realli a complet implement of pem , becaus pem specifi certif for authent key , which ripem doe not handl at thi time . their addit is plan . 9 ) what 's thi about distribut and authent key ? for a remot user to be abl to send secur mail to you , she must know your public key . for you to be abl to confirm that the messag receiv came from her , you must know her public key . it is import that thi inform be accur ; if a `` bad guy '' convinc her that hi key is in fact your , she will send messag which he can read . ripem allow for three method of key manag : a central server , the distribut finger server , and a flat file . all three are describ in the ripem user guid which is part of the distribut . none of them provid perfect secur . the pem standard call for key manag by certif ; the addit of thi featur to ripem is plan , but chicken-egg issu still exist . 10 ) is n't it a bad idea to use patent algorithm in standard like pem ? thi issu ha been consid in the standard process . rfc 1310 , the specif for internet standard , ha a discuss ( section 6 ) on what specif for nondiscriminatori avail must be met for a patent method to be includ in a standard . rfc 1421 address thi issu with regard to the patent cover public-key cryptographi . thi doe not , of cours , mean that all question are settl or that everyon is in agreement . an interest exchang on the use of patent algorithm in standard with regard to public-key cryptographi is in the leagu for program freedom archiv ( avail via ftp : ftp.uu.net : /doc/lpf ) in the file bidzos.lett and bidzos.respons . ( amusingli , the lpf file on ftp.uu.net are compress with a patent algorithm . ) 11 ) what about rsadsi/pkp ? rsa data secur , inc. ( rsadsi ) is a california-bas compani special in cryptograph technolog . public key partner is a firm which hold exclus sub-licens right of the follow u.s. patent and all of their correspond foreign patent : cryptograph apparatu and method ( `` diffie-hellman '' ) ............................... no . 4,200,770 public key cryptograph apparatu and method ( `` hellman-merkl '' ) .................... no . 4,218,582 cryptograph commun system and method ( `` rsa '' ) ................................... no . 4,405,829 exponenti cryptograph apparatu and method ( `` hellman-pohlig '' ) .................... no . 4,424,414 pkp claim these four patent cover all known method of public key cryptographi . the two busi are rather close relat ( for exampl , the same person , jim bidzo , is presid of both of them . ) pkp ha licens thi technolog to a consider number of compani ( ibm , dec , motorola , at & t , lotu ... ) for use in their product . pkp ha also threaten and file lawsuit defend their patent . ripem wa origin creat with no connect to rsadsi other than it use of the rsaref librari , and for no reason other than it author 's desir to see widespread use of public-key cryptographi . howev , after the ball start roll , peopl at rsadsi got interest . rsadsi decid to carri ripem on it ftp site , and some peopl there start make their own ripem key and contribut code . ripem even won the `` best applic built on rsaref in 1992 '' award . 12 ) whi do all ripem public key look veri similar ? ripem public key begin with a pkc ( public-key cryptographi standard ) identifi describ variou characterist about the key , so the first bunch of charact in your key may be the same as those of lot of other peopl 's key . thi doe not mean your key are similar , but onli that they are the same class of key , were gener with the same program , are of the same length , etc . 13 ) what is pgp ? pgp is anoth cryptograph mail program call pretti good privaci . pgp ha been around longer than ripem , and work somewhat differ . pgp is not compat with ripem in ani way , though pgp doe also use rsa . a few major differ between pgp and ripem : - pgp ha more key manag featur , particularli for user without a direct network connect . - ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probabl of work with other pem softwar . pgp make no attempt to be compat with anyth other than itself . - ripem use rsaref , a librari of rsa routin from rsadsi which come with a licens allow noncommerci use . pgp use it own implement of rsa . pkp claim that it is a violat of it patent to `` make , use or sell '' pgp in the u.s. or canada without either a licens or written permiss . ( see : `` disclaim '' ) ( see : `` what about rsadsi/pkp ? '' ) phil zimmermann , the author of pgp , stop distribut it after be threaten with legal action ; he believ that a licens scheme could be arrang , but it ha n't happen and there seem littl prospect of it happen in the futur . he acknowledg in the pgp user 's guid : # in fact , if you live in the usa , and you are not a feder agenc , # you should n't actual run pgp on your comput , becaus public # key partner want to forbid you from run my softwar . pgp is # contraband . - both pgp and ripem are export-restrict , and can not be sent outsid the u.s. and canada without an export licens . howev , pgp alreadi exist on mani ftp site in europ and other place . whether you use pgp or ripem or whatev , the document to pgp is recommend read to anyon interest in such issu . unfortun , it 's not distribut separ from the program , which can be difficult to find in the u.s. on ftp site due to liabil concern . 14 ) what about rpem ? rpem stand for rabin privaci enhanc mail . it wa similar to ripem , but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin ( which is not rsa ) in an attempt to avoid the patent on public-key system . it wa written by mark riordan , who later wrote ripem . it distribut wa halt when , contrari to the belief of mani ( includ rabin ) , pkp claim that their patent were broad enough to cover the cipher employ . thi claim is not univers accept , but wa not challeng for pragmat reason . rpem is not realli use anymor . it is not compat with ripem or pgp . 15 ) what is mime ?

'' * how do i break a vigener ( repeated-key ) cipher ? a repeated-key cipher , where the ciphertext is someth like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey ( and so on ) , is call a vigener cipher . if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english , do the follow : 1 . discov the length of the key by count coincid . ( see gain [ gai44 ] , sinkov [ sin66 ] . ) tri each displac of the ciphertext against itself , count those byte which are equal . if the two ciphertext portion have use the same key , someth over 6 % of the byte will be equal . if they have use differ key , then less than 0.4 % will be equal ( assum random 8-bit byte of key cover normal ascii text ) . the smallest displac which indic an equal key is the length of the repeat key . 2 . shift the text by that length and xor it with itself . thi remov the key and leav you with text xore with itself . sinc english ha about 1 bit of real inform per byte , 2 stream of text xore togeth ha 2 bit of info per 8-bit byte , provid plenti of redund for choos a uniqu decrypt . ( and in fact one stream of text xore with itself ha just 1 bit per byte . ) if the key is short , it might be even easier to treat thi as a standard polyalphabet substitut . all the old cryptanalysi text show how to break those . it 's possibl with those method , in the hand of an expert , if there 's onli ten time as much text as key . see , for exampl , gain [ gai44 ] , sinkov [ sin66 ] . * how do i send encrypt mail under unix ? [ pgp , ripem , pem , ... ] here 's one popular method , use the de command : cat file | compress | de private_key | uuencod | mail meanwhil , there is a de jure internet standard in the work call pem ( privaci enhanc mail ) . it is describ in rfc 1421 through 1424 . to join the pem mail list , contact pem-dev-request @ tis.com . there is a beta version of pem be test at the time of thi write . there are also two program avail in the public domain for encrypt mail : pgp and ripem . both are avail by ftp . each ha it own newsgroup : alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem . each ha it own faq as well . pgp is most commonli use outsid the usa sinc it use the rsa algorithm without a licens and rsa 's patent is valid onli ( or at least primarili ) in the usa . ripem is most commonli use insid the usa sinc it use the rsaref which is freeli avail within the usa but not avail for shipment outsid the usa . sinc both program use a secret key algorithm for encrypt the bodi of the messag ( pgp use idea ; ripem use de ) and rsa for encrypt the messag key , they should be abl to interoper freeli . although there have been repeat call for each to understand the other 's format and algorithm choic , no interoper is avail at thi time ( as far as we know ) . * is the unix crypt command secur ? no . see [ ree84 ] . there is a program avail call cbw ( crypt breaker 's workbench ) which can be use to do ciphertext-onli attack on file encrypt with crypt . one sourc for cbw is [ ftpcb ] . * how do i use compress with encrypt ? a number of peopl have propos do perfect compress follow by some simpl encrypt method ( e.g. , xor with a repeat key ) . unfortun , you can onli compress perfectli if you know the exact distribut of possibl input . for all practic purpos it' imposs to describ `` the typic english text '' beyond coars characterist such as single-lett frequenc . you can build up more and more sophist model of your input , but if the enemi ha a slightli more accur model , he 'll be abl to find some redund in your compress output . note that nearli all practic compress scheme , unless they have been design with cryptographi in mind , produc output that actual start off with high redund . for exampl , the output of unix compress begin with a well-known three-byt `` magic number '' that can serv as an enter wedg for cryptanalysi . thi is not to say that compress befor encrypt is inher a bad idea ; it just ha to be done veri , veri care , and by no mean remov the need for strong encrypt . compress after encrypt is silli . * is there an unbreak cipher ? ye . the one-tim pad is unbreak ; see part 4 . unfortun the one-tim pad requir secur distribut of as much key materi as plaintext . of cours , a cryptosystem need not be utterli unbreak to be use . rather , it need to be strong enough to resist attack by like enemi for whatev length of time the data it protect is expect to remain valid . * what doe `` random '' mean in cryptographi ? cryptograph applic demand much more out of a pseudorandom number gener than most applic . for a sourc of bit to be cryptograph random , it must be comput imposs to predict what the nth random bit will be given complet knowledg of the algorithm or hardwar gener the stream and the sequenc of 0th through n-1st bit , for all n up to the lifetim of the sourc . a softwar gener ( also known as pseudo-random ) ha the function of expand a truli random seed to a longer string of appar random bit . thi seed must be larg enough not to be guess by the oppon . ideal , it should also be truli random ( perhap gener by a hardwar random number sourc ) . those who have sparcstat 1 workstat could , for exampl , gener random number use the audio input devic as a sourc of entropi , by not connect anyth to it . for exampl , cat /dev/audio | compress - > foo give a file of high entropi ( not random but with much random in it ) . one can then encrypt that file use part of itself as a key , for exampl , to convert that seed entropi into a pseudo-random string . when look for hardwar devic to provid thi entropi , it is import realli to measur the entropi rather than just assum that becaus it look complic to a human , it must be `` random '' . for exampl , disk oper complet time sound like they might be unpredict ( to mani peopl ) but a spin disk is much like a clock and it output complet time are rel low in entropi . * what is the unic point ( a.k.a . unic distanc ) ? see [ sha49 ] . the unic distanc is an approxim to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real inform ( entropi ) in the correspond sourc text and encrypt key equal the number of ciphertext bit use . ciphertext significantli longer than thi can be shown probabl to have a uniqu decipher . thi is use to back up a claim of the valid of a ciphertext-onli cryptanalysi . ciphertext significantli shorter than thi are like to have multipl , equal valid decrypt and therefor to gain secur from the oppon 's difficulti choos the correct one . unic distanc , like all statist or information-theoret measur , doe not make determinist predict but rather give probabilist result : name , the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is like that there is onli a singl intellig plaintext correspond to the ciphertext , when all possibl key are tri for the decrypt . work cryptologist do n't normal deal with unic distanc as such . instead they directli determin the likelihood of event of interest . let the unic distanc of a cipher be d charact . if fewer than d ciphertext charact have been intercept , then there is not enough inform to distinguish the real key from a set of possibl key . de ha a unic distanc of 17.5 charact , which is less than 3 ciphertext block ( each block correspond to 8 ascii charact ) . thi may seem alarmingli low at first , but the unic distanc give no indic of the comput work requir to find the key after approxim d charact have been intercept . in fact , actual cryptanalysi seldom proce along the line use in discuss unic distanc . ( like other measur such as key size , unic distanc is someth that guarante insecur if it 's too small , but doe n't guarante secur if it 's high . ) few practic cryptosystem are absolut impervi to analysi ; all manner of characterist might serv as enter `` wedg '' to crack some cipher messag . howev , similar information-theoret consider are occasion use , for exampl , to determin a recommend key chang interv for a particular cryptosystem . cryptanalyst also employ a varieti of statist and information-theoret test to help guid the analysi in the most promis direct . unfortun , most literatur on the applic of inform statist to cryptanalysi remain classifi , even the semin 1940 work of alan ture ( see [ koz84 ] ) . for some insight into the possibl , see [ kul68 ] and [ goo83 ] . * what is key manag and whi is it import ? one of the fundament axiom of cryptographi is that the enemi is in full possess of the detail of the gener cryptograph system , and lack onli the specif key data employ in the encrypt . ( of cours , one would assum that the cia doe not make a habit of tell mossad about it cryptosystem , but mossad probabl find out anyway . ) repeat use of a finit amount of key provid redund that can eventu facilit cryptanalyt progress . thu , especi in modern commun system where vast amount of inform are transfer , both parti must have not onli a sound cryptosystem but also enough key materi to cover the traffic . key manag refer to the distribut , authent , and handl of key . a publicli access exampl of modern key manag technolog is the stu iii secur telephon unit , which for classifi use employ individu code `` crypto ignit key '' and a central key manag center oper by nsa . there is a hierarchi in that certain cik are use by author cryptograph control personnel to valid the issuanc of individu traffic key and to perform installation/mainten function , such as the report of lost cik . thi should give an inkl of the extent of the key manag problem . for public-key system , there are sever relat issu , mani have to do with `` whom do you trust ? '' * can i use pseudo-random or chaotic number as a key stream ? chaotic equat and fractal produc an appar random from rel compact gener . perhap the simplest exampl is a linear congruenti sequenc , one of the most popular type of random number gener , where there is no obviou depend between seed and output . unfortun the graph of ani such sequenc will , in a high enough dimens , show up as a regular lattic . mathemat thi lattic correspond to structur which is notori easi for cryptanalyst to exploit . more complic gener have more complic structur , which is whi they make interest pictur -- - but a cryptograph strong sequenc will have no comput structur at all . see [ knu81 ] , exercis 3.5-7 ; [ ree77 ] ; and [ boy89 ] . * what is the correct frequenc list for english letter ? there are three answer to thi question , each slightli deeper than the one befor . you can find the first answer in variou book : name , a frequenc list comput directli from a certain sampl of english text . of cours ani such list will be `` correctli '' comput , but exactli which list you get depend on which sampl wa taken . the second answer is that the question doe n't make sens . what do you mean by `` english letter '' ? the `` english languag '' is not a fix , finit , close object that can be exactli character . it ha chang over time ; it is differ between differ author . ani particular messag will have differ statist from those of the languag as a whole . the third answer is that ye , no particular messag is go to have exactli the same characterist as english in gener , but for all reason statist use these slight discrep wo n't matter . in fact there 's an entir field call `` bayesian statist '' ( other buzzword are `` maximum entropi method '' and `` maximum likelihood estim '' ) which studi question like `` what 's the chanc that a text with these letter frequenc is in english ? '' and come up with reason robust answer . so make your own list from your own sampl of english text . it will be good enough for practic work , if you use it properli . * what is the enigma ? `` for a project in data secur we are look for sourc of inform about the german enigma code and how it wa broken by the british dure wwii . '' see [ wel82 ] , [ dea85 ] , [ koz84 ] , [ hod83 ] , [ kah91 ] . * how do i shuffl card ? card shuffl is a special case of the permut of an array of valu , use a random or pseudo-random function . all possibl output permut of thi process should be equal like . to do thi , you need a random function ( modran ( x ) ) which will produc a uniformli distribut random integ in the interv [ 0 .. x-1 ] . given that function , you can shuffl with the follow [ c ] code : ( assum arrlth is the length of array arr [ ] and swap ( ) interchang valu at the two address given ) for ( n = arrlth-1 ; n > 0 ; n -- ) swap ( & arr [ modran ( n+1 ) ] , & arr [ n ] ) ; modran ( x ) can not be achiev exactli with a simpl ( ranno ( ) % x ) sinc ranno ( ) 's interv may not be divis by x , although in most case the error will be veri small . to cover thi case , one can take ranno ( ) 's modulu mod x , call that number y , and if ranno ( ) return a valu less than y , go back and get anoth ranno ( ) valu . * can i foil s/w pirat by encrypt my cd-rom ? someon will frequent express the desir to publish a cd-rom with possibl multipl piec of softwar , perhap with each encrypt separ , and will want to use differ key for each user ( perhap even good for onli a limit period of time ) in order to avoid piraci . as far as we know , thi is imposs , sinc there is noth in standard pc or workstat hardwar which uniqu identifi the user at the keyboard . if there were such an identif , then the cd-rom could be encrypt with a key base in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the uniqu identifi . howev , in thi case the cd-rom is one of a kind and that defeat the intend purpos . if the cd-rom is to be encrypt onc and then mass produc , there must be a key ( or set of key ) for that encrypt produc at some stage in the process . that key is useabl with ani copi of the cd-rom 's data . the pirat need onli to isol that key and sell it along with the illeg copi . * can you do automat cryptanalysi of simpl cipher ? utah sell product that break the password scheme of a number of popular macintosh and pc softwar packag . their telephon number is ( 801 ) 224-6970 no pd softwar ha been cite but there are mani paper on the subject .... peleg , s. and rosenfeld , a . `` break substitut cipher use a relax algorithm '' comm . acm vol . 22 ( 11 ) pp 598-605 ( nov. 1979 ) luck , michael , `` a constraint satisfact algorithm for the autom decrypt of simpl substitut cipher '' , advanc in cryptolog -- crypto '88 , springer lectur note in comput scienc , vol . 403 ( the paper also contain refer to earlier work on the subject . ) john carrol and steve martin , `` the autom cryptanalysi of substitut cipher '' , cryptologia , vol x number 4 , oct 86 p193-209 . john carrol and lynda robbin , `` autom cryptanalysi of polyalphabet cipher '' , cryptologia , vol xi number 4 , oct 87 p193-205 martin kochanski , `` a survey of data insecur packag '' , cryptologia , vol xi number 1 , jan 87 p1-15 martin kochanski , `` anoth data insecur packag '' , cryptologia , vol xii number 3 , juli 88 , p165-177 . cryptologia vol xiii number 4 1989 pp 303-326 . king and bahler , `` probabilist relax in the cryptanalysi of simpl substitut cipher '' cryptologia 16 ( 3 ) :215-225 . king and bahler , `` an algorithm solut of sequenti homophon cipher '' . cryptologia , april 93 ( in press ) . r. spillman et.al. , `` use of genet algorithm in cryptanalysi of simpl substitut cipher '' , cryptologia , vol xvii number 1 , jan 93 p31-44 . * what is the code system use by vcr+ ? one veri frequent ask question in sci.crypt is about how the vcr+ code work . the follow articl attempt to describ it .\",\n \" that sound like an old _dragnet_ episod . `` joe and i went to the apart of prime suspect . nobodi answer the door , but hi landlord gave us permiss to search the apart .

new product to acceler the develop and use of advanc and secur telecommun network and wireless commun link . for too long there ha been littl or no dialogu between our privat sector and the law enforc commun to resolv the tension between econom vital and the real challeng of protect american . rather than use technolog to accommod the sometim compet interest of econom growth , privaci and law enforc , previou polici have pit govern against industri and the right of privaci against law enforc . sophist encrypt technolog ha been use for year to protect electron fund transfer . it is now be use to protect electron mail and comput file . while encrypt technolog can help american protect busi secret and the unauthor releas of person inform , it also can be use by terrorist , drug dealer , and other crimin . a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' ha been develop by govern engin . the chip repres a new approach to encrypt technolog . it can be use in new , rel inexpens encrypt devic that can be attach to an ordinari telephon . it scrambl telephon commun use an encrypt algorithm that is more power than mani in commerci use today . thi new technolog will help

activ . in order to assess technolog trend and explor new approach ( like the key-escrow system ) , the presid ha direct govern agenc to develop a comprehens polici on encrypt that accommod : -- the privaci of our citizen , includ the need to employ voic or data encrypt for busi purpos ; -- the abil of author offici to access telephon call and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessari to protect our citizen ; -- the effect and time use of the most modern technolog to build the nation inform infrastructur need to promot econom growth and the competit of american industri

enforc agenc is conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggl ring and intercept a convers encrypt use the devic . what would they have to do to deciph the messag ? a : they would have to obtain legal author , normal a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . they would then present document of thi author to the two entiti respons for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the devic be use by the drug smuggler . the key is split into two part , which are store separ in order to ensur the secur of the key escrow system . q : who will run the key-escrow data bank ? a : the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independ entiti . at thi point , the depart of justic and the administr have yet to determin which agenc will overse the key-escrow data bank . q : how strong is the secur in the devic ? how can i be sure how strong the secur is ? a : thi system is more secur than mani other voic encrypt system readili avail today . while the algorithm will remain classifi to protect the secur of the key escrow system , we are will to invit an independ panel of cryptographi expert to evalu the algorithm to assur all potenti user that there are no unrecogn vulner . q : whose decis wa it to propos thi product ? a : the nation secur council , the justic depart , the commerc depart , and other key agenc were involv in thi decis . thi approach ha been endors by the presid , the vice presid , and appropri cabinet offici . q : who wa consult ? the congress ? industri ? a : we have on-go discuss with congress and industri on encrypt issu , and expect those discuss to intensifi as we carri out our review of encrypt polici . we have brief member of congress and industri leader on the decis relat to thi initi . q : will the govern provid the hardwar to manufactur ? a : the govern design and develop the key access encrypt microcircuit , but it is not provid the microcircuit to product manufactur . product manufactur can acquir the microcircuit from the chip manufactur that produc them . q : who provid the `` clipper chip '' ? a : mykotronx program it at their facil in torranc , california , and will sell the chip to encrypt devic manufactur . the program function could be licens to other vendor in the futur . q : how do i buy one of these encrypt devic ? a : we expect sever manufactur to consid incorpor the `` clipper chip '' into their devic . q : if the administr were unabl to find a technolog solut like the one propos , would the administr be will to use legal remedi to restrict access to more power encrypt devic ? a : thi is a fundament polici question which will be consid dure the broad polici review . the key escrow mechan will provid american with an encrypt product that is more secur , more conveni , and less expens than other readili avail today , but it is just one piec of what must be the comprehens approach to encrypt technolog , which the administr is develop . the administr is not say , `` sinc encrypt threaten the public

'court order requir ' ha proven to be a rather flimsi guarante . if the case warrant , they can alway siez the materi , and forc one to give the key , or sit in jail forev on period renew contempt charg . so it is not deni the justic system the inform , nor the abil to lock someon up if guilti ( or refus to divulg the mean to access the info - thi is not protect under the fifth - one can be forc to perform act that would result in divulg incrimin evid ) . so , block restrict on privat encrypt is not prevent legitim law enforc - it doe make illegitim law enforc a bunch more difficult . especi fish expedit without the target 's knowleg . do n't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negoti , and clinton and co. know it ( which is probabl whi they quietli develop thi thing , figur if they get it thi far , they can ram it on through ) . how come those consult could be roughli describ as `` us insid '' ? they can not quiet impliment it though , when they ban other scheme to ensur it exclus use . henc the nice pr document to tri and reassur everyon . do n't buy into it . ha govern realli earn that kind of trust , past or futur ? to be secur and free , one must keep govern honest and the onli way to do that is to make abus imposs , not 'unlikely' or 'difficult ' . so what ? one could use inform gain by re-us of the key ( save after the last case wa finish ) or other mean ( master key , backdoor , easili broken algorithm ) to find other evid which , given to a judg , would author a tap which would n't have been possibl otherwis . thi ha been the more common manner of abus of wiretap in the past ... for local cop , thi might be workabl to keep them honest , but the fed have a workaround somehow , bet on it . doe anyon realli believ for exampl , that the govern will use a scheme nsa can not listen in on scan for keyword - either easili defeat in realtim or via a 'master key ' ? i sure do n't . thi whole thing sound like someth to elimin the need to use old-fashion polic work to build a case . in the past , eavesdrop wa rather easi ( with or without a court order ) . i think the law enforc commun ha becom a bit spoil , and will resist chang that requir them to revert to use old-fashion detect work . i just find it somewhat surpris come from a bunch that care so much about civil and individu right , that `` put peopl first '' . the question is `` put peopl first '' to where ? with the innard not be reveal , how is one to be sure there doesn't exist a 'master key ' for use by nsa , etc ( so they can do their keyword scan , etc on convers they routin monitor , without a specif court order ) ? rememb , the cellular phone limiti is onli temporari . bet on it . and so far i have not heard about polic tell peopl that they have been tap and noth incrimin wa found . what is to keep them from simpli keep the key on file for 'next time ' ? after awhil , they would have quit a collect . kept especi for folk they deem 'disrupt ' . and if they get onli one key , that would reduc the search space a lot , unless it is an rsa scheme . rememb nixon year ? need for court order realli slow them down , did n't it ? and unless the escrow account are not govern control ( fat chanc ! i see one end up be under , say treasuri , the other under justic : - ) ) it could be worth some seriou buck to some folk to get key to a competitor 's clinton clipper ( or descend when thi idea is expand to be use for all non-govern encrypt ) . enough buck would get one the key or the innard for thi algorithm . perhap not an import concern , but given past govern behavior and the other problem ... what will one do when it is expand to data storag encrypt ? you can bet that if clipper is accept , that will be next on the agenda . it is even hint at in the propos - read it care ... expect the argumet `` well , if you got noth to hide ... '' fine . then use that argument , one should not object to video camera be instal in everi room of one 's home . grant - an extem expans of the idea but the principl hold . privat stuff should remain privat , even from a govt fish expedit . and laws/rul may chang in the futur as to 'safeguard ' . when it come to the fed govern , safeguard are pretti meaningless , if they want to do/get someth . do n't work so hard to give up some rather treasur right , or establish bad precid , pleas . the price could be hell to pay , later . peopl would fight law forbid more now , but in , say two year , becaus we have thi 'crisi ' situat which must be address by some 'drastic action ' , just thi ad reason restrict will onli bother those who have somet to hide ... etc . pleas do n't buy into it . if the clinton clipper is so veri good , whi not make it algrithm public so mani peopl can exchang idea and examin it , rather than a few isol 'respect expert ' ( respect by whom ? for what ? perhap a certain professor who like key bank would be one of the select expert ... thi doe seem to expand on some idea the person wa advoc , if i recal : - ) . how would anybodi know that what the expert examin is the same as what will end up be use in the clipper chip , if it is kept secret ? perhap the clipper will use a crippl version ( with a 'master key ' provis ) , or featur not present in the version subject for studi and evalu by the expert . and who choos the expert ? the govern ? no conflict of interest there ... : - ) and is n't it a requir for ani decent encrypt scheme that it not have it effect reduc by have the algrorithm wide known ? i wa lead to believ that one should assum the other side ha everyth you have , except for the key ( s ) ... i recal idea present to thi group are reject if a requir exist the algorithm be secret ... anoth question - sinc it is a safe bet thi clipper thing would not be use for govern secur , they are regard it as not real secur but `` good enough '' for common folk . i think i would like to see a full descript ( not a pr non-stat ) of just what `` good enough '' mean ? i think when say how strong it is , `` good enough '' realli mean `` not veri '' . the excus that other countri have these restrict is not accept : other countri do not have our bill of right and constitut ( which the peopl , not the govern , of those other countri often regard with envi - what we have as right they have as revok privileg ) . and if we expect to retain those right and protect , we must not allow them to be gut becaus we just got ta have thi thing to 'fight crime ' . we have allreadi have our bill of right pretti much torn to shred . we should not permit more weakin for yet anoth 'nobl caus ' , instead we should be tri to repair the damag . our crime problem may have a number of caus , but `` too mani right and safeguard '' is not a signifig one . a broken court system and poor polic work are a much more signifig caus as have '' too mani right '' ( disregard address the root caus for crime , etc ) . btw - those who suggest that thi is just an attack on clinton , believ thi : i would be go ballist reagardless who serious propos thi thing . it is just anoth step in a gradual eros of our right under the constitut or bill of right . the last coupl of decad have been a non-stop seri of end-run around the protect of the constitut

by the press secretari the presid today announc a new initi that will bring the feder govern togeth with industri in a voluntari program to improv the secur and privaci of telephon commun while meet the legitim need of law enforc . the initi will involv the creation of new product to acceler the develop and use of advanc and secur telecommun network and wireless commun link . for too long there ha been littl or no dialogu between our privat sector and the law enforc commun to resolv the tension between econom vital and the real challeng of protect american . rather than use technolog to accommod the sometim compet interest of econom growth , privaci and law enforc , previou polici have pit govern against industri and the right of privaci against law enforc . sophist encrypt technolog ha been use for year to protect electron fund transfer . it is now be use to protect electron mail and comput file . while encrypt technolog can help american protect busi secret and the unauthor releas of person inform , it also can be use by terrorist , drug dealer , and other crimin . a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' ha been develop by govern engin . the chip repres a new approach to encrypt technolog . it can be use in new , rel inexpens encrypt devic that can be attach to an ordinari telephon . it scrambl telephon commun use an encrypt algorithm that is more power than mani in commerci use today . thi new technolog will help compani protect proprietari inform , protect the privaci of person phone convers and prevent unauthor releas of data transmit electron . at the same time thi technolog preserv the abil of feder , state and local law enforc agenc to intercept law the phone convers of crimin . a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensur that the '' clipper chip '' is use to protect the privaci of law-abid american . each devic contain the chip will have two uniqu 2 '' key , '' number that will be need by author govern agenc to decod messag encod by the devic . when the devic is manufactur , the two key will be deposit separ in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney gener . access to these key will be limit to govern offici with legal author to conduct a wiretap . the `` clipper chip '' technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american . to demonstr the effect of thi new technolog , the attorney gener will soon purchas sever thousand of the new devic . in addit , respect expert from outsid the govern will be offer access to the confidenti detail of the algorithm to assess it capabl and publicli report their find . the chip is an import step in address the problem of encrypt 's dual-edg sword : encrypt help to protect the privaci of individu and industri , but it also can shield crimin and terrorist . we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provid law-abid citizen with access to the encrypt they need and prevent crimin from use it to hide their illeg activ . in order to assess technolog trend and explor new approach ( like the key-escrow system ) , the presid ha direct govern agenc to develop a comprehens polici on encrypt that accommod : -- the privaci of our citizen , includ the need to employ voic or data encrypt for busi purpos ; -- the abil of author offici to access telephon call and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessari to protect our citizen ; -- the effect and time use of the most modern technolog to build the nation inform infrastructur need to promot econom growth and the competit of american industri in the global marketplac ; and -- the need of u.s. compani to manufactur and export high technolog product . the presid ha direct earli and frequent consult with affect industri , the congress and group that advoc the privaci right of individu as polici option are develop . 3 the administr is commit to work with the privat sector to spur the develop of a nation inform infrastructur which will use new telecommun and comput technolog to give american unpreced access to inform . thi infrastructur of high-spe network ( `` inform superhighway '' ) will transmit video , imag , hdtv program , and huge data file as easili as today 's telephon system transmit voic . sinc encrypt technolog will play an increasingli import role in that infrastructur , the feder govern must act quickli to develop consist , comprehens polici regard it use . the administr is commit to polici that protect all american ' right to privaci while also protect them from those who break the law . further inform is provid in an accompani fact sheet . the provis of the presid 's direct to acquir the new encrypt technolog are also avail . for addit detail , call mat heyman , nation institut of standard and technolog , ( 301 ) 975-2758 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - question and answer about the clinton administration' telecommun initi q : doe thi approach expand the author of govern agenc to listen in on phone convers ? a : no . `` clipper chip '' technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american . q : suppos a law enforc agenc is conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggl ring and intercept a convers encrypt use the devic . what would they have to do to deciph the messag ? a : they would have to obtain legal author , normal a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . they would then present document of thi author to the two entiti respons for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the devic be use by the drug smuggler . the key is split into two part , which are store separ in order to ensur the secur of the key escrow system . q : who will run the key-escrow data bank ? a : the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independ entiti . at thi point , the depart of justic and the administr have yet to determin which agenc will overse the key-escrow data bank . q : how strong is the secur in the devic ? how can i be sure how strong the secur is ? a : thi system is more secur than mani other voic encrypt system readili avail today . while the algorithm will remain classifi to protect the secur of the key escrow system , we are will to invit an independ panel of cryptographi expert to evalu the algorithm to assur all potenti user that there are no unrecogn vulner . q : whose decis wa it to propos thi product ? a : the nation secur council , the justic depart , the commerc depart , and other key agenc were involv in thi decis . thi approach ha been endors by the presid , the vice presid , and appropri cabinet offici . q : who wa consult ? the congress ? industri ? a : we have on-go discuss with congress and industri on encrypt issu , and expect those discuss to intensifi as we carri out our review of encrypt polici . we have brief member of congress and industri leader on the decis relat to thi initi . q : will the govern provid the hardwar to manufactur ? a : the govern design and develop the key access encrypt microcircuit , but it is not provid the microcircuit to product manufactur . product manufactur can acquir the microcircuit from the chip manufactur that produc them . q : who provid the `` clipper chip '' ? a : mykotronx program it at their facil in torranc , california , and will sell the chip to encrypt devic manufactur . the program function could be licens to other vendor in the futur . q : how do i buy one of these encrypt devic ? a : we expect sever manufactur to consid incorpor the `` clipper chip '' into their devic . q : if the administr were unabl to find a technolog solut like the one propos , would the administr be will to use legal remedi to restrict access to more power encrypt devic ? a : thi is a fundament polici question which will be consid dure the broad polici review . the key escrow mechan will provid american with an encrypt product that is more secur , more conveni , and less expens than other readili avail today , but it is just one piec of what must be the comprehens approach to encrypt technolog , which the administr is develop . the administr is not say , `` sinc encrypt threaten the public safeti and effect law enforc , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countri have effect done ) ; nor is the u.s. say that `` everi american , as a matter of right , is entitl to an unbreak commerci encrypt product . '' there is a fals `` tension '' creat in the assess that thi issu is an `` either-or '' proposit . rather , both concern can be , and in fact are , harmoni balanc through a reason , balanc approach such as is propos with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encrypt techniqu . q : what doe thi decis indic about how the clinton administr 's polici toward encrypt will differ from that of the bush administr ? a : it indic that we understand the import of encrypt technolog in telecommun and comput and are commit to work with industri and public-interest group to find innov way to protect americans' privaci , help busi to compet , and ensur that law enforc agenc have the tool they need to fight crime and terror . q : will the devic be export ? will other devic that use the govern hardwar ? a : voic encrypt devic are subject to export control requir . case-by-cas review for each export is requir to ensur appropri use of these devic . the same is true for other encrypt devic . one of the attract of thi technolog is the protect it can give to u.s. compani oper at home and abroad . with thi in mind , we expect export licens will be grant on a case-by-cas basi for u.s. compani seek to use these devic to secur their own commun abroad . we plan to review the possibl of permit wider export of these product . -- -- -- -- -- - end includ articl -- -- -- -- -- -\",\n ' the hc711 is an eprom version of the hc11 . raw hc11 part have factori set rom imag , and as such are useless to the hobbyist . hc811 part have eeprom , allow for electr erasur and reprogram . some motorola part ( such as the hc705k1 ) have eprom , make them user programm , but come with option of either window or seal . the more expens window packag allow multipl use , the plastic dip varieti are one-tim programm , sinc there is no way of expos the eprom array to light . johnh -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- | _ |_ _ |_| _ _| _| electron depart |_| ( _ ) | | | | | | ( _| ( _| ( _| \\\\/ school of mpce -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -/- macquari univers sydney , australia 2109 email : johnh @ mpce.mq.edu.au , ph : +61 2 805 8959 , fax : +61 2 805 8983',\n \" a surplus-d buddi of mine came up with two emul pod : hp64220c ( for hp 64100 develop station ) . 8086 target processor . dip head . doe not includ board that plug into the 64100 . appli microsystem 80c186/188 pod , lcc head . if you have an interest in either , let me know . they look to be in excel condit . he doe n't know what to do with them , which may mean that they 'll be cheap . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- dave medin phone : ( 205 ) 730-3169 ( w ) ssd -- network ( 205 ) 837-1174 ( h ) intergraph corp. m/ gd3004 internet : dtmedin @ catbyte.b30.ingr.com huntsvil , al 35894 uucp : ... uunet ! ingr ! b30 ! catbyt ! dtmedin * * * * * * * everywher you look ( at least around my offic ) * * * * * * *\",\n \" in regard to fractal commpress , i have seen 2 fractal compress `` movi '' . they were both fairli impress . the first one wa a 64 gray scale `` movi '' of casablanca , it wa 1.3mb and had 11 minut of 13 fp video . it wa a littl graini but not bad at all . the second one i saw wa onli 3 minut but it had 8 bit color with 10fp and measur in at 1.2mb . i consid the fractal movi a practic thing to explor . but unlik mani other format out there , you do end up lose resolut . i do n't know what kind of software/hardwar wa use for creat the `` movi '' i saw but the guy that show them to me said it took 5-15 minut per frame to gener . but as i said abov playback wa 10 or more frame per second . and how els could you put 11 minut on one floppi disk ?\",\n \" : i 'm tri out the c++ graphic packag interview . besid the man page : on the class , i have n't got ani document . is there anyth els : around ? furthermor , can anyon send me a ( small ! ) exampl program : which show how to use these class togeth ? i would be veri grateful ...\",\n \" obvious the polic offic read the speedomet . i can not believ the nit-pick in thi group . there 's 2 beam , there is not , is too , etc ....\",\n \" > the algorithm is classifi becaus a militari contract ( or similar > govern equival to militari ) ha been let for thi `` proprietari '' > design that the fed say that nsa develop . is there a patent ? is that > patent publicli avail ? my bet is that that too is classifi . unless there ha been a _major_ chang in the law , there 's no such beast as a `` classifi patent .

( it depend on the util code from the abov gaskin book ; instruct for fetch it via anonym ftp are given . ) the problem to be solv is to elimin or minim `` stitch '' artifact result from the use of z-buffer with polylin that are coplanar with fill area . the interpol z valu along a line will differ slightli , due to roundoff error , from the interpol z valu across an area , even when the endpoint of the line are coincid with vertic of the area . becaus of thi , it 's a tossup whether the z-buffer will allow the line pixel or the area pixel to be display . visual , the result tend to be a dashed-lin effect even though the line is suppos to be solid . use the pexlib api , my approach to a solut is to use two slightli differ pex view map transform , in two view tabl entri , one for the area and one for the line . the pex structur or immediate- mode output must be organ so that one view tabl index is alway in effect for area , and the other is alway in effect for line . the result is a slight shift in npc z coordin for the line , so as to attempt to bia the tossup situat in favor of the line . thi shift is effect by move the front and back clip plane use in the pexlib view tabl entri for line just a hair `` backward '' ( i.e . smaller vrc z coordin ) , compar to their posit in the view tabl entri use for area . thi mean that when a point is transform to npc , it z valu will be slightli bigger if it come from a line than if it come from an area , thu accomplish the desir bia . i would expect the z roundoff error which caus the problem to amount to a few unit at most , out of the entir dynam rang of the z-buffer , typic from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 ( i.e . 16 or 24 bit z-buffer ) . therefor , it seem that a tini fraction of the rang of z in vrc between the front and back clip plane ought to suffic to reliabl fix the stitch . but in fact , experi show that the shift ha to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the rang . ( empir , it 's worst when the npc z compon of the slope of the surfac is high , i.e . when it appear more or less edge-on to the viewer . ) it 's as if onli 8 or 9 bit of the z-buffer have ani depend mean ! thi amount is so great that one problem is replac by anoth : sometim the polylin `` show through '' area which they are suppos to lie behind . i 've observ the problem on both hewlett-packard and digit workstat pex server , to approxim the same degre . the test program demonstr the problem on an mit pexlib 5.x implement ; thi version is known to compil and run on an hp-ux system with pex 5.1 . open question : ( 1 ) whi doe thi happen ? -- am i configur the pex view tabl wrongli ? -- is there a systemat differ in z interpol for line as oppos to area ( e.g . pixel center versu corner ) which could be correct for ? -- are pex implementor wantonli discard z precis in their interpol ? -- someth els ?

[ note that xv 2.21 doe n't provid an easi way of modifi the gamma of an imag . you need to adjust the r , g and b curv to the appropri gamma in the coledit control . alter the intens in the hsv control doe n't do the right thing , as it fail to take account of the effect gamma ha on h and s. thi tend to give a tint to the imag . ] how can i figur out what my viewer doe , or what gamma my screen ha ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - the simplest way to do that is to tri load the file chkgamma.jpg ( provid with xli distribut ) , which is a jfif jpeg format file contain two grayscal ramp . the ramp are chosen to look linear to the human eye , one use continu tone , and the other use dither . if your viewer doe the right thing and gamma correct imag , then the two ramp should look symmetr , and the point at which they look equal bright should be almost exactli half way from the top to the bottom . ( to find thi point it help if you move away a littl from the screen , and de-focu your eye a bit . ) if your viewer doe n't do gamma correct , then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part , and the point of equal bright will be abov the center . if your viewer doe have a way of set the right amount of gamma correct for a display , then if the equal bright point is abov center increas the gamma , and decreas it if it is below the center . the valu will usual be around 2.2 [ with xli for instanc , you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag , and onc you 've got it right , you can set the display_gamma environ variabl in your .profil ] how do i figur out what the gamma of an imag is ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - thi is the most tricki bit . as a gener rule it seem that a lot of true color ( ie . 24 bit , .ppm .jpg ) imag have a gamma of 1.0 ( linear ) , although there are mani about that have some gamma correct . it seem that the major of pseudo color imag ( ie . 8 bit imag with color map - .gif etc . ) are gamma correct to some degre or other . if your viewer doe gamma correct then linear imag will look good , and gamma correct imag will look too light . if your viewer doe n't do gamma correct , then linear imag will look too dark , and gamma correct imag will ok. whi linear imag are sometim not such a good thing -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - one of the reason that mani high qualiti format ( such as video ) use gamma correct is that it actual make better use of the storag medium . thi is becaus the human eye ha a logarithm respons to light , and gamma correct ha a similar compress characterist . thi mean imag could make better use of 8 bit per color ( for instanc ) , if they use gamma correct . the implic though , is that everi time you want to do ani imag process you should convert the 8 bit imag to 12 or so linear bit to retain the same accuraci . sinc littl popular softwar doe thi , and none of the popular imag format can agre on a standard gamma correct factor , it is difficult to justifi gamma correct imag at the popular level . if some imag format can standard on a particular gamma , and if imag manipul softwar take care to use extra precis when deal with linear intern data , then gamma correct distribut of imag would be a good thing . ( i am told that the kodak photocd format for instanc , ha a standard gamma correct factor that enabl it to get the highest qualiti out of the bit use to hold the imag ) .\",\n ' from articl < qekn3b4w165w @ sys6626.bison.mb.ca > , by baden @ sys6626.bison.mb.ca ( baden de bari ) :',\n ' ... you can find cross refer to almost ani ic or discret semiconductor in philip ecg : semiconductor master replac guid , ~ $ 10 .

( the except is that u exist outsid of the chip , on a program diskett . that 's serious wrong . u_1 and u_2 should be load onto the chip separ . ) to those who disagre ( and i don't claim my answer is obviou , though i found my own reason suffici persuas that i wa forc to rewrit the conclus section of my technic analysi paper -- i had origin blast the scheme ) , i issu thi invit : assum that you were charg with implement such a system , with complet regard for civil right and due process . what would you do differ ? in answer thi question , pleas accept nsa 's fundament assumpt : that both strong cryptographi against outsid , and the abil to wiretap * some * domest user , is necessari .

( `` sorri , guy ; all them terrorist and drug dealer and pedophil seem to have bought triple-d phone instead . who 'd ' a ' thunk it ? '' ) i have no answer to thi question , and at the moment , i do n't see a way of answer it . those concern are part of my reason in my answer to the final question , below . the third , and most seriou issu , is whether or not clipper is a good idea even if carri out strictli accord to the letter of the law . i think that the answer is no , but it 's not a no-brain . i 'm a civil libertarian , not a libertarian , for reason that i explain at great length on the net in the elder day , and that i do n't have the energi to repeat now . but that mean that i 'm will to accept that some law are necessari , so long as they respect the essenti right of individu . the govern alreadi ha the abil and -- in our system -- the right to issu search warrant , and while that power ha certainli been abus , it 's also been use quit properli and fairli in other case . is key escrow suffici differ ? i think so -- but again , it 's not an easi question for me .

what can the govern do to prevent thi ? start take away all microchip analysi facil and electron microscop ? ?',\n \" thi topic wa beaten to death a year or so ago . the concret is not the problem . lead-acid batteri often fail from disus ( not be charg for a long time ) , but there 's no way the concret floor could be the caus of the problem .\",\n \" sure the way is on differ okay , so what do you do if some part of the machin ( presum the part on which the code number or whatev that the program ha fixat itself upon goe bad , you replac that part , and now your program wo n't run becaus it 's on a `` differ '' comput ? ? ? thi is , of cours , assum that the program use someth in rom ( like the bio serial number , mayb ? ) and not a disk-bas code number . obvious if the drive goe bad you 'll be reinstal the stuff anyway . i work in a comput lab which is part of the univers microlab system . we have the wonder fun task of maintain well over a hundr machin , both pc and macintosh , as well as administ a network of over 50 next machin . i person am concern onli with a small lab with ten pc 's and ten mac 's . ( i 'm not the manag , but help him with admin often ) . imho , copy-protect scheme of ani sort are noth more than a major headach for the legitim user . anyon who want a copi of your program and doe n't care about legal will get a copi . period . `` pirat board '' or no pirat board . i too have `` friend '' who blatantli and quit successfuli `` hack '' copi protect scheme practic in their sleep . let 's consid what goe on in our lab . almost daili we have at least one machin down , sometim sever , due to some goofbal screw up some set or other on a piec of softwar . admittedli , we ( be student , mostli ) are not the world 's most effici and effect network administr , but we tri . keep even the twenti machin that are ( partli ) my respons even vagu look and `` act '' similar to the averag user , and maintain `` behind-the-scen '' consist is a real headach , but not so bad a headach as tri to rememb twenti differ folder locat of norton util when some guy trash hi disk . often we have hardwar problem at peak `` busi '' time and have to do some parts-swap to get stuff work temporarili . . . . well , i 'll cut to the chase and quit bore y'all . . .. the point is , often we have to re-instal softwar and copi configur file etc . from machin to machin . by far the easiest way we have found to do thi is to get one machin work exactli the way we want to , then copi the complet setup of thi machin to the other nine ( of that machin 's type ) . thi ensur us that ( for at least ten minut ) we have ten ident machin to work with . have them network simplifi thi consider , as our major packag ( wordperfect , window , etc . ) are all network version and thu onli one copi to mess with . often , howev , we need to instal a packag request by some instructor to one , some , or all of the machin for a special project . thi is usual a hand-written or sharewar , etc . program similar to what i believ the origin poster wa ask about . the few we have had with `` copi protect '' scheme have caus noth but nightmar for us to maintain . . in short , do n't wast your time with a copi protect scheme . it 's sort of like outlaw gun . the crimin will get your program anyway , and you will onli be hurt the legitim , honest user . write a good user 's guid and tech manual , whatev els for your program ( pleas do thi regardless of whether you copi protect the thing ! ! ! ) , and onli distribut the manual to licens user . jack the price to cut your loss , but pleas take a cue from the major compani ( who can admittedli afford the cost of illeg copi far better than you ) and do n't burden the legitim user with a `` copi protect '' scheme ! sorri for the tirad , but it 's been a long day here . . .. : - ) mark s. underwood ee student , univers of kentucki lab assist , boyd hall microlab ( a tini littl divis of uk librari microlab ) e-mail : msunde01 @ mik.uky.edu\",\n ' could someon repost or send to me via email the origin post of the clipper chip press releas . thank andrew kriger hampshir colleg agk @ neural.hampshire.edu',\n ' i wa wonder if anyon knew of where i could find sourc code for a program to solv a substitut cipher ?

there would not be a need to transfer chip one at a time into a littl pla programm as some peopl have envis . my guess as to whi thi procedur is use is that base the key on the s1 and s2 use a specifi algorithm provid an ( in-principl ) checkabl way to verifi that no back door exist in the choic of the random number use to gener the key . sinc we have to trust the escrow compani anyway , it doe not weaken the system to have the key be gener from random seed enter by the escrow agent . and sinc the algorithm for key-gener is public ( modulo skipjack secreci ) then in principl an agent could challeng the procedur , ask for s1 and s2 to be expos , and run hi own independ calcul of u1 and u2 to verifi that that is what is actual be put onto the floppi . and ye , there are mani way in which failur to follow thi scheme could be hard to check . the laptop probabl will not realli be destroy each time . hidden camera in the ceil could see the s1 and s2 enter by the trust escrow agent . back door in the chip could allow u to be recov . heck , each chip could be record with the same u , ignor what wa on the floppi .\",\n \" ever sinc craig rowland post hi piec `` new encrypt '' to sci.crypt there ha been some discuss of our compani , secur commun technolog , inc , and on encrypt algorithm , nea . i spoke to craig at length on 4/21/93 and we cover a lot of ground . some of the inform in the post requir some clarif , and i would like to answer some of the question rais on sci.crypt . sct is a small compani base in silver spring maryland . our two main product at thi time are a pc base secur commun program call secom and a gener purpos encrypt chip which use the nea algorithm develop for secom . secom provid an encrypt secur commun link between two pc 's connect over dial up telephon line . it support simultan bi-direct file transfer and keyboard to screen `` chat '' . it ha it own proprietari commun protocol which is tightli integr to the encrypt . all though it is a packet link , the data stream appear to be continu becaus the packet boundari are hidden . when secom wa initi develop , it wa implement to use de encrypt . a busi decis wa made to seek export approv for the product becaus it wa perceiv that the oversea market wa a larg one and provid a good market opportun . we soon found out that we would never be grant gener export approv for anyth use de . all though the reason for thi wa never explicitli state , it seem to have someth to do with secret govern to govern agreement which are still in effect . in ani event , the decis wa made to develop a new and differ algorithm which would take the place of de . thi wa the reason nea ( new encrypt algorithm ) wa born . at thi time nea is be held as a trade secret . the preliminari work of patent it ha begun , and the plan is to make it public onc the patent process is complet . all though one can make certain legal argument for keep it an ongo secret , i think in the case of an encrypt algorithm it is necessari to let peopl `` shoot at it '' over an extend period of time to prove it worth . in order to get export approv for secom/nea , it wa necessari to go through nsa and to reveal to them the detail of the program and algorithm . thi wa done onli after we had a finish product to submit . let me state unequivoc that there is no `` back door '' to the program or the algorithm . secur commun technolog is a close held privat compani and nsa/fbi/cia/nist/whatev ha no financi interest in ani way whatsoev with the compani or ani of the peopl involv . from a practic busi standpoint , we are interest in sell chip and softwar ( hope in larg quantiti ) and a back door to the encrypt , if found out , could destroy our credibl and our busi . with the encrypt algorithm approv for export , we set out to talk to a number of potenti custom for encrypt product and system . we were abl to identifi sever common thread of function requir . thi led to the design of a chip with the encrypt algorithm `` cast in silicon '' and certain other capabl ad so that the chip could fulfil the broad rang of requir that we identifi . we are strongli oppos to the clipper/capston chip . in a press releas today , our presid , dr. stephen bryen state : `` it seem as if the govern ha an unlimit sourc of fund to use to push it new bug chip on the american public . but do we not understand how the nation secur agenc , which is not suppos to be involv in domest spi , can fund the develop of a commerci chip intend to accommod u.s. govern domest spi activ .

( thi figur doe not includ wiretap obtain with the consent of a parti to the convers . ) 2057 arrest result from wiretap start the same year , 1486 arrest came from wiretap in previou year , and 55 % of arrest led to convict . 76 % of the wiretap were for phone ( vs pager , email , etc . ) , 60 % were regard drug offens , and 40 % were request by feder author . each wiretap instal heard an averag of 1487 call , 22 % of them incrimin , among 131 peopl , and cost an averag of $ 45,125 ( extrapol from the 794 instal report cost ) , mostli for labor . thu a total of about $ 40 million wa spent on wiretap , to obtain about 4000 arrest , at $ 10,000 per arrest . thu these arrest are at least four time more expens than the $ 2500 per arrest figur one get by divid the $ 28 billion spent by all polic nation by the total 11 million non-traff arrest [ 3 ] . thu the $ 30 million per year spent on phone tap is onli one thousanth of the total polic expenditur . and if we divid thi by the 138 million phone `` access '' line in the countri [ 3 ] , we get about 23 cent spent per year per phone line , or about two cent a month . in gener , we deter a given class of crimin through a combin of a perceiv probabl of be caught and convict , and some expect punish level if convict . so the social valu of have wiretap is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same crimin deterr through other mean . if unabl to wiretap a particular suspect 's phone , polic might instead use hidden microphon , or investig that suspect in other way . or polic might focu on suspect more easili investig without wiretap . or we might rais the fine or prison time for certain type of crime . if we gener assum that these substitut for wiretap would be on averag twice as expens as wiretap , then the annual social benefit of phone wiretap is about equal to the current spend level of two cent a month per phone line . wiretap cost let us for the moment optimist assum that the us govern encrypt scheme is as secur as whatev privat enterpris would have offer instead , protect our convers from the spi ear of neighbor , corpor , and govern , both foreign and domest . even so , the need to support wiretap would add mani addit cost to build and maintain our commun system . extra law enforc block would be ad to phone transmiss , increas traffic by some unknown percentag . a special process must be use to add encrypt key to chip , while secur distribut these key to special agenc , which must be fund and monitor . the chip themselv are design by a militari contractor , whose design is to remain secret , and are manufactur through a special process so that the chip becom nearli imposs to take apart . ( chip are now offer at the rel high price of $ 30 a peic in lot of 10,000 [ 4 ] . ) privat encrypt system not support wiretap would requir none of these extra cost . perhap most import , govern degre would at least partial replac privat marketplac evolut of standard for how voic is to be repres , encrypt , and exchang in our futur phone . it is wide believ that govern are less effici than privat enterpris in procur product and standard , though they may perhap perform a use broker role when we choos between compet privat standard . how much less effici is a matter of debat , some say they pay twice as much , while other might say onli 10 % more . current , a total of $ 96 billion is spent as oper expens of u.s. phone compani [ 3 ] , which come out to about $ 60 per month per access line . if we compar thi to the wiretap valu of two cent per month , we see that if wiretap rais averag oper cost by even as much as one part in 3000 , then wiretap are not cost effect ! and thi doe n't even includ extra cost phone owner pay becaus their encrypt chip are more expens . of cours most phone would n't have encrypt chip for a while , but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same , so thi argument still appli . conclus given thi dramat differ between the total cost of run the phone system and the valu of wiretap , we can justifi onli the slightest modif of the phone system to accommod wiretap . when the onli modif requir wa to allow investig in to attach clip to phone wire , wiretap support may have been reason . but when we consid substanti modif , the burden of proof is clearli on those propos such modif to show that the cost would realli be less than the benefit . if consensu can not be obtain on thi cost/benefit estim , a compromis might be to tax phone which do not support wiretap at a rate of say five cent per month , a tax payabl to polic agenc nationwid to compens them for their loss of wiretap abil .

have and have not read . the system may not reli upon regist peopl as own particular phone unit , but it is necessari to know which phone unit are like to be use for some suspect crimin commun befor you can obtain their unit key from escrow . thi necess rais the stake in favor of a criminal' coerc or collud use of some other person 's clipper phone . i will restat my assumpt more explicitli and amplifi my argument . the origin titl perhap should have been `` distinct between legal and illeg cipher system consid harm '' , but `` clipper consid harm '' is not inaccur , and is more eye-catch in the current context . assumpt : 1 . clipper is made avail . 2 . law are pass to make use of cipher system other than clipper illeg ( either on radio system , or on ani common carrier system ) . these law also includ enforc author to listen across the relev radio spectrum ( or other medium ) , character signal , valid clipper wrapper , detect probabl use of non-clipp cipher , and make such detect a caus for further action . 3 . for escrow key to be use , some specif clipper chip must be associ with a suspect crimin . thi mean that at a minimum some associ between the common carrier 's uniqu phone id ( esn ) and the clipper chip serial number n will be store in a govern databas . an observ pair of n and esn other than the one record rais a red flag . 4 . to reduc ordinari fraud , the cellphon system which offer clipper will also be construct with an esn mechan much more tamper-proof and much less spoofabl than today 's cellphon . 5 . crimin want inscrut commun . some crimin are not entir stupid or ignor , and will figur out both that clipper cellphon offer excel secur in normal circumst , and that they offer no secur against law enforc onc a ( presum legitim ) wiretap order exist . they will also figur out that the wiretap order must necessarili be against a specif cellphon , becaus each one ha a uniqu unit key . 6 . crimin do not want to call attent to themselv . becaus they are not stupid or ignor ( or becaus they read netnew ) , and becaus they know that their open use of a non-clipp cipher is like to be detect , they will gener avoid use non-clipp cipher directli on some monitorable/tapp channel . they know that do so would rais a red flag , put a given cellphon ( if not a given person ) under immedi suspicion . 7 . it is impract to revers engin skipjack , discov famili key f , and construct a function clone of a clipper chip . by # 2 , # 3 , # 4 , and # 7 it will be veri difficult to spoof a given clipper phone without immedi detect . becaus it is difficult to obscur one' associ to a specif phone by reprogram or chang chip around , the crimin will be motiv to find an intact phone which is associ with someon els . a non-stupid crimin will conclud that they can have clipper-secur commun , at least for some limit time t , if they buy , beg , borrow , or steal use of someon 's phone in a way that prevent that person from report compromis of the phone for at least time t. the encrypt commun might have been record , and thu be retriev later , but the crimin can delay , and quit like evad , discoveri by destroy or abandon the phone befor t elaps . it would be unusu for an innoc person to volunt use of their clipper phone to someon els . the honest subscrib doe n't want to pay someon els 's bill , and he doe n't want to fall under suspicion . thi leav two sourc of clipper phone for crimin use : coercion and collus . coercion first . theft bear a rel low risk , but also sometim a low time until detect ( a few minut if a phone is stolen from a car park in front of a store , a coupl of week if a phone is stolen from someon who is away on vacat ) . crimin commerc is like to aris in stolen clipper phone , with phone come from risk-inur poor crimin , and cash come from risk-avers wealthi crimin . someon who is extraordinarili motiv to gain a day or two of undetect commun ( like a terrorist ) could kill a person or hold them hostag . the limit time ( befor detect ) that a coerc phone is use mean that continu crimin enterpris requir a continu suppli of freshli coerc phone . there would also be creat a collus commerc between rel wealthi crimin , and ignor or don't-car patsi who need money , and who will submit to be paid in return for subscrib to clipper phone servic for someon els 's use . crimin will learn that it is more to their advantag to coerc use of a clipper cellphon than it is to appli a non-clipp cipher to a normal cellphon . they will call much less attent to themselv ( or at least to their stolen phone ) thi way . the fact of a phone 's use be coerc must first be report befor it can be identifi as an interest phone , and have it key obtain from escrow . clipper also allow an extraordinari opportun for the crimin to conceal use of super-encrypt . an autom full-system surveil mechan ( quit feasibl across radio bandwidth ) which know famili key f , can valid clipper wrapper and n : esn associ , but it can not reveal in realtim the use of super-encrypt , unless it know all unit key , which we are be assur are onli to be made avail in two separ piec , upon specif wiretap-lik order . wherea a crimin 's use of ani cipher within a normal cleartext medium would stand out , a crimin 's use of a non-clipp cipher within a clipper medium would be veri difficult to detect , even ex post facto in bulk record , as long as the associ between crimin and specif clipper chip is fractur . if you make use of thi other cipher illeg per se , then you can charg the crimin with thi ( if you can identifi the true crimin - he 'll be use someon els 's phone ) , but you 'll have no evid to help you against whatev tradit crime he might have been plan . you will not even be abl to detect that unusu ( encrypt ) commun are occur until you identifi specif phone and obtain their key from escrow . the gangster and terrorist are thu arguabl more , not less , secur than they were befor clipper came along . i therefor consid clipper harm becaus : 1 . it doe not provid absolut privaci to the honest public against aggress or dishonest govern . 2 . if other cipher are proscrib , it engend new type of direct crimin threat to the honest public . 3 . it provid an extraordinarili effect mechan for crimin to hide their use of some other cipher , make it more difficult than ever even to gain notic that unusu commun are occur and that plan for some crimin act might be in progress . 4 . if other cipher are proscrib , lazi investig and prosecutor are more like to pursu the easili quantifi cipher-us crime than they are the tradit and directli harm crime which key escrow is claim to help against . 5 . if other cipher are proscrib , the stage is set for witch hunt of `` illeg '' cipher use . becaus ani comput can be use as a cipher machin ...\",\n \" with regard to what you wrote , how doe one `` adjust for room dynam and stuff like that '' ? i ask a professor that question just

[ 14 ] what are some rule of thumb for convert gif imag to jpeg ? section 1-6 are basic info that everi jpeg user need to know ; section 7-14 are advanc info for the curiou . thi articl is post everi 2 week . you can alway find the latest version in the news.answ archiv at rtfm.mit.edu ( 18.70.0.226 ) . by ftp , fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq ; or if you do n't have ftp , send e-mail to mail-serv @ rtfm.mit.edu with bodi `` send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq '' . mani other faq articl are also store in thi archiv . for more instruct on use of the archiv , send e-mail to the same address with the word `` help '' and `` index '' ( no quot ) on separ line . if you do n't get a repli , the server may be misread your return address ; add a line such as '' path mynam @ mysit '' to specifi your correct e-mail address to repli to . -- -- -- -- -- [ 1 ] what is jpeg ? jpeg ( pronounc `` jay-peg '' ) is a standard imag compress mechan . jpeg stand for joint photograph expert group , the origin name of the committe that wrote the standard . jpeg is design for compress either full-color or gray-scal digit imag of `` natur '' , real-world scene . it doe not work so well on non-realist imag , such as cartoon or line draw . jpeg doe not handl black-and-whit ( 1-bit-per-pixel ) imag , nor doe it handl motion pictur compress . standard for compress those type of imag are be work on by other committe , name jbig and mpeg respect . jpeg is `` lossi '' , mean that the imag you get out of decompress isn't quit ident to what you origin put in . the algorithm achiev much of it compress by exploit known limit of the human eye , notabl the fact that small color detail are n't perceiv as well as small detail of light-and-dark . thu , jpeg is intend for compress imag that will be look at by human . if you plan to machine-analyz your imag , the small error introduc by jpeg may be a problem for you , even if they are invis to the eye . a use properti of jpeg is that the degre of lossi can be vari by adjust compress paramet . thi mean that the imag maker can trade off file size against output imag qualiti . you can make * extrem * small file if you do n't mind poor qualiti ; thi is use for index imag archiv , make thumbnail view or icon , etc . etc . convers , if you are n't happi with the output qualiti at the default compress set , you can jack up the qualiti until you are satisfi , and accept lesser compress . [ 2 ] whi use jpeg ? there are two good reason : to make your imag file smaller , and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data . make imag file smaller is a big win for transmit file across network and for archiv librari of imag . be abl to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbyte or so make a big differ in disk space and transmiss time ! ( if you are compar gif and jpeg , the size ratio is more like four to one . more detail below . ) if your view softwar doe n't support jpeg directli , you 'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipul imag . even with a jpeg-cap viewer , it take longer to decod and view a jpeg imag than to view an imag of a simpler format ( gif , for instanc ) . thu , use jpeg is essenti a time/spac tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an imag more cheapli . it 's worth note that when network or phone transmiss is involv , the time save from transfer a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . i 'll let you do the arithmet yourself . the other reason whi jpeg will gradual replac gif as a standard usenet post format is that jpeg can store full color inform : 24 bits/pixel ( 16 million color ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer color ) . if you have onli 8-bit display hardwar then thi may not seem like much of an advantag to you . within a coupl of year , though , 8-bit gif will look as obsolet as black-and-whit macpaint format doe today . furthermor , for reason detail in section 7 , jpeg is far more use than gif for exchang imag among peopl with wide vari color display hardwar . henc jpeg is consider more appropri than gif for use as a usenet post standard . [ 3 ] when should i use jpeg , and when should i stick with gif ? jpeg is * not * go to displac gif entir ; for some type of imag , gif is superior in imag qualiti , file size , or both . one of the first thing to learn about jpeg is which kind of imag to appli it to . as a rule of thumb , jpeg is superior to gif for store full-color or gray-scal imag of `` realist '' scene ; that mean scan photograph and similar materi . jpeg is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardwar , and it is a lot superior if you do . ( see section 7 for detail . ) gif doe significantli better on imag with onli a few distinct color , such as cartoon and line draw . in particular , larg area of pixel that are all * exactli * the same color are compress veri effici inde by gif . jpeg ca n't squeez these file as much as gif doe without introduc visibl defect . thi sort of imag is best kept in gif form . ( in particular , single-color border are quit cheap in gif file , but they should be avoid in jpeg file . ) jpeg also ha a hard time with veri sharp edg : a row of pure-black pixel adjac to a row of pure-whit pixel , for exampl . sharp edg tend to come out blur unless you use a veri high qualiti set . again , thi sort of thing is not found in scan photograph , but it show up fairli often in gif file : border , overlaid text , etc . the blurri is particularli objection with text that 's onli a few pixel high . if you have a gif with a lot of small-siz overlaid text , do n't jpeg it . computer-drawn imag ( ray-trac scene , for instanc ) usual fall between scan imag and cartoon in term of complex . the more complex and subtli render the imag , the more like that jpeg will do well on it . the same goe for semi-realist artwork ( fantasi draw and such ) . plain black-and-whit ( two level ) imag should never be convert to jpeg . you need at least about 16 gray level befor jpeg is use for gray-scal imag . it should also be note that gif is lossless for gray-scal imag of up to 256 level , while jpeg is not . if you have an exist librari of gif imag , you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg . you will lose a littl imag qualiti if you do . ( section 7 , which argu that jpeg imag qualiti is superior to gif , onli appli if both format start from a full-color origin . if you start from a gif , you 've alreadi irretriev lost a great deal of inform ; jpeg can onli make thing wors . ) howev , the disk space save may justifi convert anyway . thi is a decis you 'll have to make for yourself . if you do convert a gif librari to jpeg , see section 14 for hint . be prepar to leav some imag in gif format , sinc some gif will not convert well . [ 4 ] how well doe jpeg compress imag ? pretti darn well . here are some sampl file size for an imag i have handi , a 727x525 full-color imag of a ship in a harbor . the first three file are for comparison purpos ; the rest were creat with the free jpeg softwar describ in section 6b . file size in byte comment ship.ppm 1145040 origin file in ppm format ( no compress ; 24 bit or 3 byte per pixel , plu a few byte overhead ) ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file pass through unix compress compress doe n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note . other text-ori compressor give similar result . ship.gif 240438 convert to gif with ppmquant -f 256 | ppmtogif most of the save is the result of lose color info : gif save 8 bits/pixel , not 24 . ( see sec . 7 . ) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -q 95 ( highest use qualiti set ) thi is indistinguish from the 24-bit origin , at least to my nonprofession eyebal . ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -q 75 ( default set ) you have to look mighti darn close to distinguish thi from the origin , even with both on-screen at onc . ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -q 50 thi ha slight defect ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it 's been jpege without see the origin . still as good imag qualiti as mani recent post in usenet pictur group . ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -q 25 jpeg 's characterist `` blocki '' becom appar at thi set ( djpeg -blocksmooth help some ) . still , i 've seen plenti of usenet post that were of poorer imag qualiti than thi . ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optim ( -optim cut tabl overhead ) blocki , but perfectli satisfactori for preview or index purpos . note that thi file is tini : the compress ratio from the origin is 173:1 ! in thi case jpeg can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of compar qualiti ( the -q 75 file is everi bit as good as the gif , better if you have a full-color display ) . thi seem to be a typic ratio for real-world scene . [ 5 ] what are good `` qualiti '' set for jpeg ? most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. imag qualiti tradeoff by select a qualiti set . there seem to be widespread confus about the mean of these set . `` qualiti 95 '' doe not mean `` keep 95 % of the inform '' , as some have claim . the qualiti scale is pure arbitrari ; it 's not a percentag of anyth . the name of the game in use jpeg is to pick the lowest qualiti set ( smallest file size ) that decompress into an imag indistinguish from the origin . thi set will vari from one imag to anoth and from one observ to anoth , but here are some rule of thumb . the default qualiti set ( -q 75 ) is veri often the best choic . thi set is about the lowest you can go without expect to see defect in a typic imag . tri -q 75 first ; if you see defect , then go up . except for experiment purpos , never go abov -q 95 ; say -q 100 will produc a file two or three time as larg as -q 95 , but of hardli ani better qualiti . if the imag wa less than perfect qualiti to begin with , you might be abl to go down to -q 50 without objection degrad . on the other hand , you might need to go to a higher qualiti set to avoid further degrad . the second case seem to appli much of the time when convert gif to jpeg . the default -q 75 is about right for compress 24-bit imag , but -q 85 to 95 is usual better for convert gif ( see section 14 for more info ) . if you want a veri small file ( say for preview or index purpos ) and are prepar to toler larg defect , a -q set in the rang of 5 to 10 is about right . -q 2 or so may be amus as `` op art '' . ( note : the qualiti set discuss in thi articl appli to the free jpeg softwar describ in section 6b , and to mani program base on it . other jpeg implement , such as imag alchemi , may use a complet differ qualiti scale . some program do n't even provid a numer scale , just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' -style choic . ) [ 6 ] where can i get jpeg softwar ? most of the program describ in thi section are avail by ftp . if you do n't know how to use ftp , see the faq articl `` how to find sourc '' . ( if you do n't have direct access to ftp , read about ftpmail server in the same articl . ) that articl appear regularli in news.answ , or you can get it by send e-mail to mail-serv @ rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sourc '' in the bodi . the `` anonym ftp list faq '' may also be help -- - it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answ archiv . note : thi list chang constantli . if you have a copi more than a coupl month old , get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answ archiv . [ 6a ] if you are look for `` can '' softwar , viewer , etc : the first part of thi list is system-specif program that onli run on one kind of system . if you do n't see what you want for your machin , check out the portabl jpeg softwar describ at the end of the list . note that thi list concentr on free and sharewar program that you can obtain over internet ; but some commerci program are list too . x window : xv ( sharewar , $ 25 ) is an excel viewer for jpeg , gif , and mani other imag format . it can also do format convers and some simpl imag manipul . it 's avail for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) , file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z . version 3.00 is a major upgrad with support for 24-bit display and mani other improv ; howev , it is brand new and still ha some bug lurk . if you prefer not to be on the bleed edg , stick with version 2.21 , also avail from export . note that version 2.21 is not a good choic if you have a 24-bit display ( you 'll get onli 8-bit color ) , nor for convert 24-bit imag to jpeg . but 2.21 work fine for convert gif and other 8-bit imag to jpeg . caution : there is a glitch in version 2.21 : be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when save a jpeg file , or the file will be blurri . anoth good choic for x window is john cristi 's free imagemagick packag , also avail from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z . thi packag handl mani imag process and convers task . the imagemagick viewer handl 24-bit display correctli ; for colormap display , it doe better ( though slower ) color quantiz than xv or the basic free jpeg softwar . both of the abov are larg , complex packag . if you just want a simpl imag viewer , tri xloadimag or xli . xloadimag support jpeg in it latest releas , 3.03. xloadimag is free and avail from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z . xli is a variant version of xloadimag , said by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the origin . ( the current xli is inde faster and more robust than the current xloadimag , at least with respect to jpeg file , becaus it ha the ijg v4 decod while xloadimag 3.03 is use a hacked-ov v1 . the next xloadimag releas will fix thi . ) xli is also free and avail from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z . both program are said to do the right thing with 24-bit display . ms-do : thi cover plain do ; for window or os/2 program , see the next head . one good choic is eric praetzel 's free dvpeg , which view jpeg and gif file . the current version , 2.5 , is avail by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97.50.50 ) , file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip . thi is a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386/486 machin . the user interfac is not flashi , but it 's function . anoth freewar jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei 's hiview . the current version , 1.2 , is avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip . hiview requir a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compat memori manag ( qemm386 and 386max work ; window and os/2 do not ) . hiview is current the fastest viewer for imag that are no bigger than your screen . for larger imag , it scale the imag down to fit on the screen ( rather than use panning/scrol as most viewer do ) . you may or may not prefer thi approach , but there 's no deni that it slow down load of larg imag consider . note : instal is a bit tricki ; read the direct care ! a sharewar altern is colorview for do ( $ 30 ) . thi is easier to instal than either of the two freewar altern . it user interfac is also much spiffier-look , although person i find it harder to use -- - more keystrok , inconsist behavior . it is faster than dvpeg but a littl slower than hiview , at least on my hardwar . ( for imag larger than screen size , dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than hiview . ) the current version is 2.1 , avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip . requir a vesa graphic driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directori . ( mani recent pc have a built-in vesa driver , so do n't tri to load a vesa driver unless colorview complain that the driver is miss . ) a second sharewar altern is fullview , which ha been kick around the net for a while , but i do n't know ani stabl archiv locat for it . the current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the abov viewer anyway . the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortli and it will be submit to the simtel20 archiv at that time . the well-known gif viewer compushow ( cshow ) support jpeg in it latest revis , 8.60a . howev , cshow 's jpeg implement is n't veri good : it 's slow ( about half the speed of the abov viewer ) and imag qualiti is poor except on hi-color display . too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capabl in cshow . sharewar , $ 25 . avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip . due to the remark varieti of pc graphic hardwar , ani one of these viewer might not work on your particular machin . if you ca n't get * ani * of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the follow convers program to convert jpeg to gif , then view with your favorit gif viewer . ( if you have hi-color hardwar , do n't use gif as the intermedi format ; tri to find a targa-cap viewer instead . vpic5.0 is reput to do the right thing with hi-color display . ) the independ jpeg group 's free jpeg convert are ftpabl from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extend memori ) . these file are do compil of the free sourc code describ in section 6b ; they will convert jpeg to and from gif , targa , and ppm format . handmad softwar offer free jpeg < = > gif convers tool , gif2jpg/jpg2gif . these are slow and are limit to convers to and from gif format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg . the major advantag of these tool is that they will read and write hsi 's proprietari jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format . sinc hsi-format file are rather widespread on bbse , thi is a use capabl . version 2.0 of these tool is free ( prior version were sharewar ) . get it from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip . note : do not use hsi format for file to be post on internet , sinc it is not readabl on non-pc platform . handmad softwar also ha a sharewar imag convers and manipul packag , imag alchemi . thi will translat jpeg file ( both jfif and hsi format ) to and from mani other imag format . it can also display imag . a demo version of imag alchemi version 1.6.2 is avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note below ) , file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip . note about simtel20 : the internet 's key archiv site for pc-relat program is simtel20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88.110.20 ) . simtel20 run a non-unix system with weird directori name ; where thi document refer to directori ( eg ) `` msdos/graph '' at simtel20 , that realli mean '' pd1 : < msdos.graph > '' . if you are not physic on milnet , you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rate from simtel20 . there are sever internet site that maintain copi ( mirror ) of the simtel20 archiv ; most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead . a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210.10.117 ) , which keep simtel20 file in ( eg ) `` /pub/msdos/graph '' . if you have no ftp capabl , you can retriev file from simtel20 by e-mail ; see inform post in comp.archives.msdos.announc to find out how . if you are outsid the usa , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is . microsoft window : there are sever window program capabl of display jpeg imag . ( window viewer are gener slower than do viewer on the same hardwar , due to window ' system overhead . note that you can run the do convers program describ abov insid a window do window . ) the newest entri is winecj , which is free and extrem fast . version 1.0 is avail from ftp.rahul.net , file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip . requir window 3.1 and 256-or-more-color mode . thi is a no-fril viewer with the bad habit of hog the machin complet while it decod ; and the imag qualiti is notic wors than other viewer . but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for preview ... jview is freewar , fairli fast , ha good on-lin help , and can write out the decompress imag in window bmp format ; but it ca n't creat new jpeg file , and it doe n't view gif . jview also lack some other use featur of the sharewar viewer ( such as bright adjust ) , but it' an excel basic viewer . the current version , 0.9 , is avail from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79.20.84 ) , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip . ( mirror of thi archiv can be found at some other internet site , includ wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) winjpeg ( sharewar , $ 20 ) display jpeg , gif , targa , tiff , and bmp imag file ; it can write all of these format too , so it can be use as a convert . it ha some other nifti featur includ color-bal adjust and slideshow . the current version is 2.1 , avail from simtel20 and mirror site ( see note abov ) , file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip . ( thi is a slow 286-compat version ; if you regist , you 'll get the 386-onli version , which is roughli 25 % faster . ) colorview is anoth sharewar entri ( $ 30 ) . thi wa an earli and promis contend , but it ha not been updat in some time , and at thi point it ha no real advantag over winjpeg . if you want to tri it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , avail from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip . ( i understand that a new version will be appear onc the author are finish with colorview for do . ) dvpeg ( see do head ) also work under window , but onli in full-screen mode , not in a window . os/2 : the follow file are avail from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123.35.151 ) . note : check /pub/upload for more recent version -- - the hobb moder is not veri fast about move upload into their perman directori . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg convers program , version 4 . /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same , for os/2 1.x . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip imag archiv 1.02 : imag conversion/view with pm graphic interfac . strong on convers function , view is a bit weaker . sharewar , $ 15 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip pmjpeg 1.1 : os/2 2.x port of winjpeg , a popular viewer for window ( see descript in window section ) . sharewar , $ 20 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip pmview 0.85 : jpeg/gif/bmp viewer . gif view veri fast , jpeg view fast if you have huge amount of ram , otherwis about the same speed as the abov program . strong 24-bit display support . sharewar , $ 20 . macintosh : most mac jpeg program reli on appl 's jpeg implement , which is part of the quicktim system extens ; so you need to have quicktim instal . to use quicktim , you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be run system 6.0.7 or later . ( if you 're run system 6 , you must also instal the 32-bit quickdraw extens ; thi is built-in on system 7 . ) you can get quicktim by ftp from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx . ( as of 11/92 , thi file contain quicktim 1.5 , which is better than qt 1.0 in sever way . with respect to jpeg , it is margin faster and consider less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file . howev , some applic seem to have compat problem with qt 1.5 . ) mac user should keep in mind that quicktim 's jpeg format , pict/jpeg , is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format . ( see section 10 for detail . ) if you post imag on usenet , make sure they are in jfif format . most of the program mention below can gener either format . the first choic is probabl jpegview , a free program for view imag that are in jfif format , pict/jpeg format , or gif format . it also can convert between the two jpeg format . the current version , 2.0 , is a big improv over prior version . get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx . requir system 7 and quicktim . on 8-bit display , jpegview usual produc the best color imag qualiti of all the current avail mac jpeg viewer . jpegview can view larg imag in much less memori than other mac viewer ; in fact , it' the onli one that can deal with jpeg imag much over 640x480 pixel on a typic 4mb mac . given a larg imag , jpegview automat scale it down to fit on the screen , rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer . ( you can zoom in on ani desir portion , though . ) some peopl like thi behavior , some do n't . overal , jpegview 's user interfac is veri well thought out . gifconvert , a sharewar ( $ 40 ) imag viewer/convert , support jfif and pict/jpeg , as well as gif and sever other imag format . the latest version is 2.3.2 . get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx . requir system 6.0.5 or later . gifconvert is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer , but it ha much more extens imag manipul and format convers capabl , so you may find it worth it sharewar fee if you do a lot of play around with imag . also , the newest version of gifconvert can load and save jfif imag * without * quicktim , so it is your best bet if your machin is too old to run quicktim . ( but it 's faster with quicktim . ) note : if gifconvert run out of memori tri to load a larg jpeg , tri convert the file to gif with jpeg convert , then view the gif version . jpeg convert , a mac version of the free ijg jpeg convers util , is avail from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx . thi will run on ani mac , but it onli doe file convers , not view . you can use it in conjunct with ani gif viewer . previou version of thi faq recommend imageri jpeg v0.6 , a jpeg < = > gif convert base on an old version of the ijg code . if you are use thi program , you definit should replac it with jpeg convert . appl 's free program pictpixi can view imag in jfif , quicktim jpeg , and gif format , and can convert between these format . you can get pictpixi from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . requir quicktim . pictpixi wa intend as a develop 's tool , and it' realli not the best choic unless you like to fool around with quicktim . some of it drawback are that it requir lot of memori , it produc rel poor color imag qualiti on anyth less than a 24-bit display , and it ha a rel unfriendli user interfac . wors , pictpixi is an unsupport program , mean it ha some minor bug that appl doe not intend to fix .

[ 7 ] what 's all thi hoopla about color quantiz ? most peopl do n't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardwar . typic display hardwar store 8 or fewer bit per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct color at a time . to display a full-color imag , the comput must map the imag into an appropri set of repres color . thi process is call `` color quantiz '' . ( thi is someth of a misnom , `` color select '' would be a better term . we 're stuck with the standard usag though . ) clearli , color quantiz is a lossi process . it turn out that for most imag , the detail of the color quantiz algorithm have much more impact on the final imag qualiti than do ani error introduc by jpeg ( except at the veri lowest jpeg qualiti set ) . sinc jpeg is a full-color format , convert a color jpeg imag for display on 8-bit-or-less hardwar requir color quantiz . thi is true for * all * color jpeg : even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg , what come out of the decompressor is * not * 256 color , but thousand of color . thi happen becaus jpeg 's lossi affect each pixel a littl differ , so two pixel that start with ident color will probabl come out with slightli differ color . each origin color get `` smear '' into a group of nearbi color . therefor quantiz is alway requir to display a color jpeg on a colormap display , regardless of the imag sourc . the onli way to avoid quantiz is to ask for gray-scal output . ( incident , becaus of thi effect it 's nearli meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg imag . even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel valu , differ jpeg decod would give you differ result becaus of roundoff error differ . i occasion see post imag describ as `` 256-color jpeg '' . thi tell me that the poster ( a ) ha n't read thi faq and ( b ) probabl convert the jpeg from a gif . jpeg can be classifi as color or gray-scal ( just like photograph ) , but number of color just is n't a use concept for jpeg . ) on the other hand , a gif imag by definit ha alreadi been quantiz to 256 or fewer color . ( a gif * doe * have a definit number of color in it palett , and the format doe n't allow more than 256 palett entri . ) for purpos of usenet pictur distribut , gif ha the advantag that the sender precomput the color quantiz , so recipi do n't have to . thi is also the * disadvantag * of gif : you 're stuck with the sender' quantiz . if the sender quantiz to a differ number of color than what you can display , you have to re-quant , result in much poorer imag qualiti than if you had quantiz onc from a full-color imag . furthermor , if the sender did n't use a high-qual color quantiz algorithm , you 're out of luck . for thi reason , jpeg offer the promis of significantli better imag qualiti for all user whose machin do n't match the sender 's display hardwar . jpeg 's full color imag can be quantiz to precis match the user 's display hardwar . furthermor , you will be abl to take advantag of futur improv in quantiz algorithm ( there is a lot of activ research in thi area ) , or purchas better display hardwar , to get a better view of jpeg imag you alreadi have . with a gif , you 're stuck forevermor with what wa sent . it 's also worth mention that mani gif-view program includ rather shoddi quantiz routin . if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display , for exampl , you are probabl get a much wors imag than you need to . thi is partli an inevit consequ of do two color quantiz ( one to creat the gif , one to display it ) , but often it' also due to sloppi . jpeg convers program will be forc to use high qualiti quantiz in order to get accept result at all , and in normal use they will quantiz directli to the number of color to be display . thu , jpeg is like to provid better result than the averag gif program for low-color-resolut display as well as high-resolut one ! final , an ever-grow number of peopl have better-than-8-bit display hardwar alreadi : 15-bit `` hi-color '' pc display , true 24-bit display on workstat and macintosh , etc . for these peopl , gif is alreadi obsolet , as it can not repres an imag to the full capabl of their display . jpeg imag can drive these display much more effect . thu , jpeg is an all-around better choic than gif for repres imag in a machine-independ fashion . [ 8 ] how doe jpeg work ? the buzz-word to know are chromin subsampl , discret cosin transform , coeffici quantiz , and huffman or arithmet entropi code . thi articl 's long enough alreadi , so i 'm not go to say more than that here . for technic inform , see the comp.compress faq . thi is avail from the news.answ archiv at rtfm.mit.edu , in file /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . if you need help in use the news.answ archiv , see the top of thi articl . [ 9 ] what about lossless jpeg ? there 's a great deal of confus on thi subject . the jpeg committe did defin a truli lossless compress algorithm , i.e. , one that guarante the final output is bit-for-bit ident to the origin input . howev , thi lossless mode ha almost noth in common with the regular , lossi jpeg algorithm , and it offer much less compress . at present , veri few implement of lossless jpeg exist , and all of them are commerci . say `` -q 100 '' to the free jpeg softwar doe not get you a lossless imag . what it doe get rid of is deliber inform loss in the coeffici quantiz step . there is still a good deal of inform loss in the color subsampl step . ( with the v4 free jpeg code , you can also say '' -sampl 1x1 '' to turn off subsampl . keep in mind that mani commerci jpeg implement can not cope with the result file . ) even with both quantiz and subsampl turn off , the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless , becaus it is subject to roundoff error in variou calcul . the maximum error is a few count in ani one pixel valu ; it 's highli unlik that thi could be perceiv by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are do machin process of an imag . at thi minimum-loss set , regular jpeg produc file that are perhap half the size of an uncompress 24-bit-per-pixel imag . true lossless jpeg provid roughli the same amount of compress , but it guarante bit-for-bit accuraci . if you have an applic requir lossless storag of imag with less than 6 bit per pixel ( per color compon ) , you may want to look into the jbig bilevel imag compress standard . thi perform better than jpeg lossless on such imag . jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on imag with 6 or more bit per pixel ; furthermor , jpeg is public domain ( at least with a huffman back end ) , while the jbig techniqu are heavili cover by patent . [ 10 ] whi all the argument about file format ? strictli speak , jpeg refer onli to a famili of compress algorithm ; it doe * not * refer to a specif imag file format . the jpeg committe wa prevent from defin a file format by turf war within the intern standard organ . sinc we ca n't actual exchang imag with anyon els unless we agre on a common file format , thi leav us with a problem . in the absenc of offici standard , a number of jpeg program writer have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' , and as a result their program are n't compat with anybodi els 's . the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that 's been coordin by peopl at c-cube microsystem . they have defin two jpeg-bas file format : * jfif ( jpeg file interchang format ) , a `` low-end '' format that transport pixel and not much els . * tiff/jpeg , aka tiff 6.0 , an extens of the aldu tiff format . tiff is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everyth you ever want to know about an imag , and a lot more besid : - ) . tiff is a lot more complex than jfif , and may well prove less transport , becaus differ vendor have histor implement slightli differ and incompat subset of tiff . it 's not like that ad jpeg to the mix will do anyth to improv thi situat . both of these format were develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg-rel product ; it 's reason like that futur commerci product will adher to one or both standard . i believ that usenet should adopt jfif as the replac for gif in pictur post . jfif is simpler than tiff and is avail now ; the tiff 6.0 spec ha onli recent been offici adopt , and it is still unus vagu on some crucial detail . even when tiff/jpeg is well defin , the jfif format is like to be a wide support `` lowest common denomin '' ; tiff/jpeg file may never be as transport . a particular case that peopl may be interest in is appl 's quicktim softwar for the macintosh . quicktim use a jfif-compat format wrap insid the mac-specif pict structur . convers between jfif and quicktim jpeg is pretti straightforward , and sever mac program are avail to do it ( see mac portion of section 6a ) . if you have an editor that handl binari file , you can strip a quicktim jpeg pict down to jfif by hand ; see section 11 for detail . anoth particular case is handmad softwar 's program ( gif2jpg/jpg2gif and imag alchemi ) . these program are capabl of read and write jfif format . by default , though , they write a proprietari format develop by hsi . thi format is not readabl by ani non-hsi program and should not be use for usenet post . use the -j switch to get jfif output . ( thi appli to old version of these program ; the current releas emit jfif format by default . you still should be care not to post hsi-format file , unless you want to get flame by peopl on non-pc platform . ) [ 11 ] how do i recogn which file format i have , and what do i do about it ? if you have an alleg jpeg file that your softwar wo n't read , it 's like to be hsi format or some other proprietari jpeg-bas format . you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file : 1 . a jfif-standard file will start with the charact ( hex ) ff d8 ff e0 , follow by two variabl byte ( often hex 00 10 ) , follow by 'jfif ' . 2 . if you see ff d8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a `` raw jpeg '' file . thi is probabl decod as-i by jfif softwar -- - it 's worth a tri , anyway . 3 . hsi file start with 'hsi1 ' . you 're out of luck unless you have hsi softwar . portion of the file may look like plain jpeg data , but they wo n't decompress properli with non-hsi program . 4 . a macintosh pict file , if jpeg-compress , will have a coupl hundr byte of header follow by a jfif header ( scan for 'jfif ' ) . strip off everyth befor the ff d8 and you should be abl to read it . 5 . anyth els : it 's a proprietari format , or not jpeg at all . if you are lucki , the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream . if you can identifi the start of the jpeg data stream ( look for ff d8 ) , tri strip off everyth befor that . in uuencod usenet post , the characterist jfif pattern is '' begin '' line m_ ] c_x ... wherea uuencod hsi file will start with '' begin '' line m : '-i ... if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the troubl of download non-jfif file . [ 12 ] what about arithmet code ? the jpeg spec defin two differ `` back end '' modul for the final output of compress data : either huffman code or arithmet code is allow . the choic ha no impact on imag qualiti , but arithmet code usual produc a smaller compress file . on typic imag , arithmet code produc a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman code . ( all the file-s number previous cite are for huffman code . ) unfortun , the particular variant of arithmet code specifi by the jpeg standard is subject to patent own by ibm , at & t , and mitsubishi . thu * you can not legal use arithmet code * unless you obtain licens from these compani . ( the `` fair use '' doctrin allow peopl to implement and test the algorithm , but actual store ani imag with it is dubiou at best . ) at least in the short run , i recommend that peopl not worri about arithmet code ; the space save is n't great enough to justifi the potenti legal hassl . in particular , arithmet code * should not * be use for ani imag to be exchang on usenet . there is some small chanc that the legal situat may chang in the futur . stay tune for further detail . [ 13 ] doe loss accumul with repeat compression/decompress ? it would be nice if , have compress an imag with jpeg , you could decompress it , manipul it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without ani further imag degrad beyond what you lost initi . unfortun thi is not the case . in gener , recompress an alter imag lose more inform , though usual not as much as wa lost the first time around . the next best thing would be that if you decompress an imag and recompress it * without chang it * then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an ident jpeg file . even thi is not true ; at least , not with the current free jpeg softwar . it 's essenti a problem of accumul of roundoff error . if you repeatedli compress and decompress , the imag will eventu degrad to where you can see visibl chang from the first-gener output . ( it usual take mani such cycl to get visibl chang . ) one of the thing on our to-do list is to see if accumul of error can be avoid or limit , but i am not optimist about it . in ani case , the most that could possibl be guarante would be that compress the unmodifi full-color output of djpeg , at the origin qualiti set , would introduc no further loss . even such simpl chang as crop off a border could caus further roundoff-error degrad . ( if you 're wonder whi , it 's becaus the pixel-block boundari move . if you crop off onli multipl of 16 pixel , you might be safe , but that 's a mighti limit capabl ! ) the bottom line is that jpeg is a use format for archiv storag and transmiss of imag , but you do n't want to use it as an intermedi format for sequenc of imag manipul step . use a lossless format ( ppm , rle , tiff , etc ) while work on the imag , then jpeg it when you are readi to file it away . asid from avoid degrad , you will save a lot of compression/decompress time thi way : - ) . [ 14 ] what are some rule of thumb for convert gif imag to jpeg ? as state earlier , you * will * lose some amount of imag inform if you convert an exist gif imag to jpeg . if you can obtain the origin full-color data the gif wa made from , it 's far better to make a jpeg from that . but if you need to save space and have onli the gif to work from , here are some suggest for get maximum space save with minimum loss of qualiti . the first rule when convert a gif librari is to look at each jpeg , to make sure you are happi with it , befor throw away the correspond gif ; that will give you a chanc to re-do the convers with a higher qualiti set if necessari . some gif may be better left as gif , as explain in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-typ gif with sixteen or fewer color do n't convert well . you may find that a jpeg file of reason qualiti will be * larger * than the gif . ( so check the size too . ) experi to date suggest that larg , high-visual-qu gif are the best candid for convers to jpeg . they chew up the most storag so offer the most potenti save , and they convert to jpeg with least degrad . do n't wast your time convert ani gif much under 100 kbyte . also , don't expect jpeg file convert from gif to be as small as those creat directli from full-color origin . to maintain imag qualiti you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg file would be ( i.e. , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file , not 1/4th as suggest in earlier comparison ) . mani peopl have develop an odd habit of put a larg constant-color border around a gif imag . while useless , thi wa nearli free in term of storag cost in gif file . it is not free in jpeg file , and the sharp border boundari can creat visibl artifact ( `` ghost '' edg ) . do yourself a favor and crop off ani border befor jpege . ( if you are on an x window system , xv 's manual and automat crop function are a veri painless way to do thi . ) cjpeg 's default q set of 75 is appropri for full-color input , but for gif input , q set of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessari to avoid imag degrad . ( if you appli smooth as suggest below , the higher q set may not be necessari . ) color gif of photograph or complex artwork are usual `` dither '' to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that gif can actual store . if you enlarg the imag , you will see that adjac pixel are often of significantli differ color ; at normal size the eye averag these pixel togeth to produc the illus of an intermedi color valu . the troubl with dither is that , to jpeg , it look like high-spatial-frequ color nois ; and jpeg ca n't compress nois veri well . the result jpeg file is both larger and of lower imag qualiti than what you would have gotten from jpege the origin full color imag ( if you had it ) . to get around thi , you want to `` smooth '' the gif imag befor compress . smooth averag togeth nearbi pixel , thu approxim the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process get rid of the rapid color chang that give jpeg troubl . appropri use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor , thu further reduc the size of the compress file , while still obtain a better-look output imag than you 'd get without smooth . with the v4 free jpeg softwar ( or product base on it ) , a simpl smooth capabl is built in . tri `` -smooth 10 '' or so when convert gif . valu of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-qual gif . heavy-hand dither may requir larger smooth factor .

felt that my origin speed test wa perhap less than realist . the movi i had been use onli had 18 frame in it ( it wa a version of the veri first movi i creat with the compact video compressor ) . i decid someth a littl longer would give closer to real-world result ( for better or for wors ) . i pull out a copi of `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' that i had record off tv a while back . about fifteen minut into the movi , there 's a sequenc where the earth shuttl is approach the space station . specif , i digit a portion of about 30 second ' durat , zoom in on the rotat space station . i figur thi would give a reason amount of movement between frame . to increas the differ between frame , i digit it at onli 5 frame per second , to give a total of 171 frame . i captur the raw footag at a resolut of 384 * 288 pixel with the spigot card in my centri 650 ( quarter-s resolut from a pal sourc ) . i then import it into premier and put it through the compact video compressor , keep the 5 fp frame rate . i creat two version of the movi : one scale to 320 * 240 resolut , the other at 160 * 120 resolut . i use the default '' 2.00 '' qualiti set in premier 2.0.1 , and specifi a key frame everi ten frame . i then ran the 320 * 240 movi through the same `` raw speed test '' program i use for the result i 'd been report earlier . result : a playback rate of over 45 frame per second . that 's right , i wa get a much higher result than with that first short test movi . just for fun , i copi the 320 * 240 movi to my extern hard disk ( a quantum lp105 ) , and ran it from there . thi time the playback rate wa onli about 35 frame per second . obvious the 230mb intern hard disk ( also a quantum ) is a signific contributor to the speed of playback . i modifi my speed test program to allow the specif of option scale factor , and tri play back the 160 * 120 movi scale to 320 * 240 size . thi time the playback speed wa over 60 fp . clearli , the poster who observ poor perform on scale playback wa see quicktim 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . i 'd tri my test with quicktim 1.0 , but i do n't think it' entir compat with my centri and system 7.1 ... unscal , the playback rate for the 160 * 120 movi wa over 100 fp . the other thing i tri wa save version of the 320 * 240 movi with '' prefer '' playback rate greater than 1.0 , and see how well they play from within movieplay ( ie with quicktim 's normal synchron playback ) . a prefer rate of 9.0 ( = > 45 fp ) did n't work too well : the playback wa veri jerki . compar thi with the raw speed test , which achiev 45 fp with eas . i ca n't believ that quicktim 's synchron code would add thi much overhead : i think the slowdown wa come from the mac system 's task switch . a prefer rate of 7.0 ( = > 35 fp ) seem to work fine : i could n't see ani evid of stutter . at 8.0 ( = > 40 fp ) i * think * i could see slight stutter , but with four key frame everi second , it wa hard to tell . i guess i could tri recreat the movi with a longer interv between the key frame , to make the stutter more notic . of cours , thi will also improv the compress slightli , which should speed up the playback perform even more ...\",\n \"

( the rel few copi machin in exist are control more inten- sive than machin gun are in the unit state . ) now the `` conserv '' posit is that we should not sell these comput to the soviet , becaus they could use them in weapon system . the `` liber '' posit is that we should sell them , in the interest of mutual trade and cooper -- and anyway , if we do n't make the sale , there will certainli be some other nation will to . for my part , i 'm readi to suggest that the libertarian posit should be to give them to the soviet for free , and if necessari , make them take them . . . and if that doesn't work load up an sr-71 blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middl of the night . paid for by privat sub- scription , of cours , not taxat . . . i confess that thi is not a posit that ha gain much support among member of the convent left-right polit spectrum , but , af- ter all , in the word of one of illuminatu 's charact , we are polit non-euclidean : the shortest distanc to a particular goal may not look anyth like what most peopl would consid a `` straight line . '' take a long enough world-view , it is arguabl that break the soviet govern- ment monopoli on inform transfer could better lead to the enfeebl and , inde , to the ultim dissolut of the soviet empir than would the product of anoth dozen missil aim at moscow . but there 's the rub : a `` long enough '' world view doe suggest that the evil , the oppress , the coerciv and the simpli stupid will `` get what they deserv , '' but what 's not immedi clear is how the rest of us can escap be kill , enslav , or pauper in the process . when the liber and other collectivist began to at- tack freedom , they possess a reason stabl , healthi , function economi , and almost unlimit time to proceed to hamstr and dismantl it . a polici of polit gradual wa at least conceiv . but now , we have patchwork crazy-quilt economi held togeth by bale wire and spit . the state not onli tax us to `` feed the poor '' while also induc farmer to slaughter milk cow and drive up food price -- it then simultan turn around and sub- sidiz research into agricultur chemic design to in- creas yield of milk from the cow left aliv . or wit the fact that a declin in the price of oil is consid as potenti frighten as a compar increas a few year ago . when the price went up , we were told , the economi risk collaps for for want of energi . the price increas wa call the `` moral equival of war '' and the fed swung into action . for the first time in american histori , the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morn be- came an issu of feder concern . now , when the price of oil drop , again we risk problem , thi time becaus ameri- can oil compani and third world basket-cas nation who sell oil may not be abl to ever pay their debt to our grossli over-extend bank . the suggest panacea is that govern should now re-rais the oil price that opec ha lower , via a new oil tax . sinc the govern is seek to rais oil price to about the same extent as opec did , what can we call thi except the `` moral equival of civil war -- the govern against it own peopl ? '' and , classic , in intern trade , can you imag- ine ani entiti in the world except a govern go to court claim that a vendor wa sell it good too cheapli and demand not onli that that naughti vendor be compel by the court to rais it price , but also that it be punish for the act of lower them in the first place ? so while the statist could afford to take a coupl of hundr year to trash our economi and our liberti -- we certainli can not count on have an equival period of stabil in which to reclaim them . i contend that there exist almost a `` black hole '' effect in the evolut of nation-st just as in the evolut of star . onc free- dom contract beyond a certain minimum extent , the state warp the fabric of the polit continuum about itself to the degre that subsequ re-emerg of freedom becom all but imposs . a good illustr of thi can be seen in the area of so-cal `` welfar '' payment . when those who sup at the public trough outnumb ( and thu outvot ) those whose tax must replenish the trough , then what possibl choic ha a democraci but to perpetu and expand the tak- ing from the few for the unearn benefit of the mani ? go down to the nearest `` welfar '' offic , find just two peopl on the dole . . . and recogn that between them they form a vote bloc that can forev outvot you on the question of who own your life -- and the fruit of your life 's labor . so essenti those who love liberti need an `` edg '' of some sort if we 're ultim go to prevail . we obvi- ousli ca n't use the altruist ' `` other-directed '' of '' work , slave , suffer , sacrific , so that next gener of a billion random stranger can live in a better world . '' recogn that , howev immor such an appeal might be , it is nonetheless an extrem power one in today 's cultur . if you can convinc peopl to work energet for a '' caus , '' care onli enough for their person welfar so as to remain aliv enough and healthi enough to continu work -- then you have a truli massiv reservoir of energi to draw from . equal clearli , thi is just the sort of ap- peal which tautolog can not be util for egoist or libertarian goal . if i were to stand up befor you tonight and say someth like , `` listen , follow me as i enunci my nobl `` caus , '' contribut your money to support the `` caus , '' give up your free time to work for the `` caus , '' strive selflessli to bring it about , and then ( after you and your children are dead ) mayb your children 's children will actu- alli live under egoism '' -- you 'd all think i 'd gone mad . and of cours you 'd be right . becaus the point i 'm tri to make is that libertarian and/or egoism will be spread if , when , and as , individu libertarian and/or egoist find it profit and/or enjoy to do so . and probabl onli then . while i certainli do not disparag the concept of poli- tical action , i do n't believ that it is the onli , nor even necessarili the most cost-effect path toward increas freedom in our time . consid that , for a fraction of the invest in time , money and effort i might expend in try- ing to convinc the state to abolish wiretap and all form of censorship -- i can teach everi libertarian who 's in- terest how to use cryptographi to abolish them unilater . there is a maxim -- a proverb -- gener attribut to the eskimo , which veri like most libertarian have al- readi heard . and while you like would not quarrel with the say , you might well feel that you 've heard it often enough alreadi , and that it ha noth further to teach us , and moreov , that mayb you 're even tire of hear it . i shall therefor repeat it now : if you give a man a fish , the say run , you feed him for a day . but if you teach a man how to fish , you feed him for a lifetim . your exposur to the quot wa probabl in some sort of a `` workfar '' vs. `` welfar '' context ; name , that if you genuin wish to help someon in need , you should teach him how to earn hi susten , not simpli how to beg for it . and of cours thi is true , if onli becaus the next time he is hungri , there might not be anybodi around will or even abl to give him a fish , wherea with the inform on how to fish , he is complet self suffici . but i submit that thi exhaust onli the first order content of the quot , and if there were noth further to glean from it , i would have wast your time by cite it again . after all , it seem to have almost a crypto-altruist slant , as though to impli that we should structur our ac- tiviti so as to maxim the benefit to such hungri beggar as we may encount . but consid : suppos thi eskimo doe n't know how to fish , but he doe know how to hunt walrus . you , on the other hand , have often gone hungri while travel thru walru countri becaus you had no idea how to catch the damn thing , and they ate most of the fish you could catch . and now suppos the two of you decid to exchang inform , barter fish knowledg for hunt knowledg . well , the first thing to observ is that a transact of thi type categor and unambigu refut the marxist premis that everi trade must have a `` winner '' and a `` loser ; '' the idea that if one person gain , it must necessarili be at the '' expens '' of anoth person who lose . clearli , under thi scenario , such is not the case . each parti ha gain some- thing he did not have befor , and neither ha been dimin- ish in ani way . when it come to exchang of inform ( rather than materi object ) life is no longer a zero-sum game . thi is an extrem power notion . the `` law of diminish return , '' the `` first and second law of thermodynam '' -- all those `` law '' which constrain our possi- biliti in other context -- no longer bind us ! now that' anarchi ! or consid anoth possibl : suppos thi hungri eskimo never learn to fish becaus the ruler of hi nation-st had decre fish illeg . becaus fish contain danger tini bone , and sometim sharp spine , he tell us , the state ha decre that their consumpt -- and even their possess -- are too hazard to the people' health to be permit . . . even by knowledg , will adult . perhap it is becaus citizen ' bodi are thought to be govern properti , and therefor it is the function of the state to punish those who improperli care for govern- ment properti . or perhap it is becaus the state gener- ousli extend to compet adult the `` benefit '' it provid to children and to the mental ill : name , a full-tim , all-pervas supervisori conservatorship -- so that they need not troubl themselv with make choic about behavior thought physic riski or moral `` naughti . '' but , in ani case , you stare stupefi , while your eskimo inform re- late how thi law is taken so serious that a friend of hi wa recent imprison for year for the crime of `` pos- session of nine ounc of trout with intent to distribut . '' now you may conclud that a societi so grotesqu oppress as to enforc a law of thi type is simpli an affront to the digniti of all human be . you may go far- ther and decid to commit some portion of your discretion- ari , recreat time specif to the task of thwart thi tyrant 's goal . ( your rational may be `` altruist '' in the sens of want to liber the oppress , or '' egoist '' in the sens of prove you can outsmart the oppressor -- or veri like some combin of these or per- hap even other motiv . ) but , sinc you have zero desir to becom a martyr to your `` caus , '' you 're not about to mount a militari campaign , or even tri to run a boatload of fish through the blockad . howev , it is here that technolog -- and in particular in- format technolog -- can multipli your efficaci liter a hundredfold . i say `` liter , '' becaus for a fraction of the effort ( and virtual none of the risk ) attend to smuggl in a hundr fish , you can quit readili produc a hundr xerox copi of fish instruct . ( if the tar- gete govern , like present-day america , at least permit open discuss of topic whose implement is re- strict , then that should suffic . but , if the govern attempt to suppress the flow of inform as well , then you will have to take a littl more effort and perhap write your fish manual on a floppi disk encrypt accord to your mythic eskimo 's public-key paramet . but as far as increas real-world access to fish you have made genuin nonzero headway -- which may continu to snowbal as other re-dissemin the inform you have provid . and you have not had to wast ani of your time tri to convert id- eolog adversari , or even tri to win over the unde- cide . recal harri brown 's dictum from `` freedom in an unfre world '' that the success of ani endeavor is in gener invers proport to the number of peopl whose persua- sion is necessari to it fulfil . if you look at histori , you can not deni that it ha been dramat shape by men with name like washington , lincoln , . . . nixon . . . marco . . . duvali . . . khadaffi . . . and their ilk . but it ha also been shape by peopl with name like edison , curi , marconi , tesla and wozniak . and thi latter shape ha been at least as per- vasiv , and not nearli so bloodi . and that 's where i 'm tri to take the libertech project . rather than beseech the state to pleas not en- slave , plunder or constrain us , i propos a libertarian net- work spread the technolog by which we may seiz freedom for ourselv . but here we must be a bit care . while it is not ( at present ) illeg to encrypt inform when govern want to spi on you , there is no guarante of what the fu- ture may hold . there have been bill introduc , for exam- ple , which would have made it a crime to wear bodi armor when govern want to shoot you . that is , if you were to commit certain crime while wear a kevlar vest , then that fact would constitut a separ feder crime of it own . thi law to my knowledg ha not pass . . . yet . . . but it doe indic how govern think . other technolog applic , howev , do inde pose legal risk . we recogn , for exampl , that anyon who help a pre-civil war slave escap on the `` underground railroad '' wa make a clearli illeg use of technolog -- as the sovereign govern of the unit state of america at that time found the buy and sell of human be quit as accept as the buy and sell of cattl . simi- larli , dure prohibit , anyon who use hi bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illeg psychoact drug , alcohol -- the control substanc , wine -- wa use technol- ogi in a way that could get him shot dead by feder agent for hi `` crime '' -- unfortun not to be restor to life when congress revers itself and re-permit use of thi drug . so . . . to quot a former presid , un-indict co- conspir and pardon felon . . . `` let me make one thing perfectli clear : '' the libertech project doe not advoc , particip in , or conspir in the violat of ani law -- no matter how oppress , unconstitut or simpli stupid such law may be . it doe engag in descript ( for educa- tional and inform purpos onli ) of technolog process , and some of these process ( like fli a plane or manufactur a firearm ) may well requir appropri li- cens to perform legal . fortun , no licens is need for the distribut or receipt of inform it- self . so , the next time you look at the polit scene and despair , think , `` well , if 51 % of the nation and 51 % of thi state , and 51 % of thi citi have to turn libertarian befor i 'll be free , then somebodi might as well cut my goddamn throat now , and put me out of my miseri '' -- recogn that such is not the case . there exist way to make your- self free . if you wish to explor such techniqu via the project , you are welcom to give me your name and address -- or a fake name and mail drop , for that matter -- and you 'll go on the mail list for my erratically-publish newslett . ani friend or acquaint whom you think would be interest are welcom as well . i 'm not even ask for stamp self- address envelop , sinc my printer can handl mail la- bel and actual postag cost are down in the nois compar with the other effort in get an issu out . if you should have an idea to share , or even a use product to plug , i 'll be glad to have you write it up for public . even if you want to be the proverbi `` free rider '' and just benefit from what other contribut -- you 're still welcom : everyth will be public domain ;
